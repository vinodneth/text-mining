A high full toss from Woakes outside off... and Afridi cuts it high over backward point for six more! It’s been called a no-ball on height too, so Afridi – strike rate 400 – has a free hit... and it’s a good wide yorker that the batsman can’t connect with. One ball left in the over, and Woakes sends down a wide outside off. 22 off the over, but he gets his man in the end.</p>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/woofwalkwag/statuses/670319604699373568"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://twitter.com/DanLucas86"">@DanLucas86</a> Erk...

He sends a searing one right between Sarfraz’s feet and I reckon it’s only the faintest inside edge that diverts it past leg stump. Sarfraz clumps into the leg side for a single, then Plunkett shows what I know by banging one in short and getting the wicket. Afridi comes in to huge cheers: “That’s a MASSIVE shot,” says Ramiz Raja, “it’s... almost a six”. Yes, it dropped inside the rope and bobbled away for four to cow corner.

A woeful full toss, high outside off, gets absolutely slaughtered cross-batted back down the ground, but Billings slides round and makes an excellent save.

The final ball is a slower one in the slot and Vince looks to have sent it down long-on’s throat, but the jumping Tanvir can only tip it over the rope for six. He was too far infield I reckon.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-565888eae4b03bf401a0bbf8"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-27T16:48:55.381Z"">4.48pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>11th over: England 78-3 (Buttler 3, Vince 13)</strong> Malik very nearly yorks Root with his first ball, a quicker, flatter one pushed into the batsman’s feet, Darren Lehman-style.

No, not that but, after a quick discussion yesterday, I was convinced this was the first time that England had played back-to-back T20s on consecutive days. As it turns out, it’s happened four times before, somewhat spoiling what would have been a tenuous preamble anyway, but the last time they did it was five years ago – against these very same opponents in this very same stadium. Bugger.</p> <p><strong>Then again, only one England player remains from those two matches, </strong>Cap’n Morgan. The short turnaround from <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/26/england-pakistan-twenty20-match-report"">yesterday’s win</a> is therefore as close to ideal preparation as this young side will get ahead of next year’s World T20. That tournament, surely, is the sole focus throughout this three-match series.</p> <p><strong>This presents a dilemma for England.</strong> Do they stick with the side that won so comprehensively yesterday, or do they bring back the likes of Root and Buttler as they look to continue their winning run (now a mighty four matches) and breed that stalwart of sporting press conference buzzwords: confidence? They need to decide on 15 names for the tournament in India, so do the likes of James Vince, Sam Billings, Stephen Parry and Liam Plunkett – all of whom impressed yesterday – get a run in the side, or do those rested get a run-out? Instinct tells me it’ll be the latter, but then I might be wrong.</p> <p><strong>We’ll find out in half an hour or so, </strong>so I’ll let you know then.

Originally BlackBerry was due to pull out in November, but the ban on its servers was put back by a month by Pakistan.</p> <p>BlackBerry chief operating officer Marty Beard said: “The truth is that the Pakistani government wanted the ability to monitor all BlackBerry Enterprise Service traffic in the country, including every email and BBM message. But BlackBerry will not comply with that sort of directive. </p> <p>“We do not support ‘back doors’ granting open access to our customers’ information and have never done this anywhere in the world.”</p> <p>Pakistan’s Telecommunications Authority ordered mobile phone operators and BlackBerry to cease using BlackBerry <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/27/pakistan-bans-blackberry-messaging-internet-services-privacy-crackdown"">servers in July</a> for “security reasons”. BlackBerry’s secure servers cannot be intercepted by the Pakistan government, meaning that messaging services, email and browsing can be obfuscated from snooping. But BlackBerry insists that it will respond to “lawful government investigative requests of criminal activity”.<br /></p> <p>Beard said: “Pakistan’s demand was not a question of public safety; we are more than happy to assist law enforcement agencies in investigations of criminal activity. Rather, Pakistan was essentially demanding unfettered access to all of our BES customers’ information. The privacy of our customers is paramount to BlackBerry, and we will not compromise that principle.”</p> <p>BlackBerry has faced similar problems in the past in India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. In 2010, BlackBerry services were <a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/02/blackberry-ban-uae-gulf-states"">banned within the UAE</a> and Saudi Arabia.

In comes Hafeez; “look out for a run-out here folks... he’s absolutely terrible between the wickets,” says Rameez Raja, wryly. Two more wides down leg, both very well stopped by Buttler, who perhaps read those a bit too easily. Oh and then a third on the bounce.

A lovely bit of timing sends the next ball through midwicket for a couple more – after that early loss of Roy, Root is looking in the mood to launch a bloody counterattack. Vince gets a couple as he whacks a drive straight to Afridi, but the ball spins off the Pakistan captain and Afridi has to chase it to the long off boundary.

He drops short to Root and the batsman picks it up, sending a beautiful hook high over long leg for the first six of the match. Root’s three boundaries so far have all looked absolutely beautiful. His fourth is less aesthetically pleasing mind, a half volley outside off dispatched over extra cover, but not quite timed and bobbling to the fence.

Another single out to deep midwicket, then Roy is struck on the pad. The ball heading miles over and down leg though I’ll wager. Yamin is still finding some good movement back into the batsmen off the pitch.

Over the wicket, the left-armer starts with a big booming wide, swinging down the leg side and Rizwan – taking the gloves from Sarfraz today – can only parry it to square leg. England take a bye, then Vince knocks square into the leg side for a couple more. The next ball he pushes straight back to the bowler and, for the third time in this series, it’s a <strong>drop </strong>by Tanvir, the ball bursting back through his raised left hand in his follow through. A quick single brings Root back on strike and he works a wristy one round to square leg for a couple more. Root looks to punch through cover point by Shehzad makes an excellent stop diving to his right, saving at least two, probably four. One more from the last ball makes eight, all run, from the over.</p> <p>Gareth Fitzgerald writes: “Hi Dan – which out of Jordan or Woakes do you find most rubbish?”</p> <p>Woakes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-565c72bde4b0fd56932e2f78"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-30T16:04:58.872Z"">4.04pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>1st over: England 3-1 (Root 1, Vince 2)</strong> Aamer Yamin opens the bowling for Pakistan, with one slip in for Jason Roy.

Joe Root strides in at number three and gets off the mark with a push to backward point.

Five times in the past they have played a three-match series in the format; never have they completed a 3-0 whitewash. Pakistan have been pretty poor and it would take a brave person to bet against this talented, likeable young bunch of players – 2-0 to the good with just this match to go – completing a second white-ball series win of the tour.</p> <p><strong>Reading <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/england-world-t20-cricket-jos-buttler-pakistan"">Vic Marks’ preview</a> raises an interesting question. </strong>Just consider the following excerpt:<br /></p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p><em>“It’s the sort of problem that the selectors like to have” is an observation trotted out whenever a side do well with key players missing. I’m never sure whether selectors really relish this situation that much. They like to know what constitutes their best side.</em></p> <p><em>But it is better to be in a “How can we possibly leave him out?” frame of mind rather than a “Who the devil can we pick?” pickle. This is where England find themselves at the moment.</em></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So I wondered:</strong> are England now better at limited overs cricket than they are at Tests?<br /></p> <p><strong>Plenty have come in from the fringes and impressed</strong> during this series. James Vince, Sam Billings, Stephen Parry and Liam Plunkett have all contributed to the T20 series victory, while Jos Butter returned to form in the ODIs. Jason Roy and Alex Hales both notched white ball hundreds, too.<br /></p> <p><strong>Contrast this with the Test squad for South Africa.</strong> Nick Compton, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Jonny Bairstow – the untested Mark Footitt and Alex Hales... none are without their merits, but do those names fill anyone with confidence before a series away to the world’s No1-ranked side? No, me neither. In fact, I’m sure I’m not alone in thinking I’d be more surprised by a Test series win over there than I would by England going ahead and actually winning the whole World T20 in India next March.<br /></p> <p><strong>Those who have watched England play limited overs cricket </strong>over the last, well, forever will read that assertion with some caution. A 3-0 series win over a side that sat at No2 in the ICC’s T20 rankings before this series might just give them pause for thought though.<br /></p> <p><strong>Play begins at 4pm GMT,</strong> or 8pm local time.

A trio of bang-on-the-money yorkers are just what are needed – just one run conceded from them – then Wahab slashes a half volley hard through backward point for four.

Tanvir smashes six more with a lovely pick up over cow corner, then Topley sends a wide down leg. He comes back well though: a slower ball and a yorker yielding consecutive dots. A mistimed release gives up another dot, outside off this time, then the last ball is dug out for a single. <strong>30 needed from the last two</strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-565755e9e4b0e0f1bc262290"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T19:00:58.824Z"">7.00pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>17th over: Pakistan 121-8 (Tanvir 16, Wahab 7) Target 161</strong> Plunkett again and Wahab turns him off the knees and very fine for four.

Plunkett comes round the wicket for the left-handed Tanvir and has the batsman diving for the ground with a very sharp, fast, well-directed bouncer. A leg bye and a single from the final two balls and that’s a fantastic effort from Plunkett: four overs, 19 dot balls, three wickets for just 21.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56575489e4b0d1c309bdaaef"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T18:56:40.292Z"">6.56pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>16th over: Pakistan 114-8 (Tanvir 16, Wahab 1) Target 161</strong> Jordan is back on and he begins with one in the slot, which Tanvir drives uppishly and hard, back down the ground for a straight four. The next one is a length ball and Tanvir slogs hard to mid on for four more. Billings pulls off another excellent stop next up when Tanvir gloves down the leg side, saving four with a good diving stop, but then Jordan fires an enormous wide across the left-hander and outside off. Back-to-back wides as Jordan strays down leg, then Tanvir slices a big slog high in the air, but it drops just short of Hales charging in from the mid off boundary; he and Morgan both hesitated as they converged on the ball. A well-run single through to the keeper then Tanvir tries to tee off again, just clearing mid off and getting two. 14 from a good over that keeps hope flickering.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56575452e4b031a227883f3b"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T18:50:48.038Z"">6.50pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>15th over: Pakistan 100-8 (Tanvir 5, Wahab 0) Target 161</strong> Plunkett is back on for Moeen, who finished with one for 30 from his four overs; I assume Morgan wants the paceman to finish this off given that Rashid hasn’t had a look in. Anwar is looking to go after England’s quickest bowler here but can only get it squirting away for singles; he looks to mow a yorker into the leg side, bottom edges between his own leg and Billings adjusts quite brilliantly to make the diving stop. An inelegant uppercut that drops short of third man brings two runs and the Pakistan hundred. That’s his final contribution though as Plunkett ends the over with the wicket.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56575349e4b0d1c309bdaaee"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T18:49:52.604Z"">6.49pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Wicket!

England won’t mind too much as this game is already just about done. That was preceded by a two and succeeded by a pair of singles, then Anwar does some damage to the final figures with a second six of the over, over long on. Still, two for 33 is decent enough from Parry.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""cc728aa21f31e64ea3f971190519b5f9e0915253""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/cc728aa21f31e64ea3f971190519b5f9e0915253/64_0_2883_1730/1000.jpg"" alt=""Anwar Ali swings that bat."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Anwar Ali swings that bat.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-26T18:55:22.837Z"">at 6.55pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-56575199e4b031a227883f2f"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T18:42:46.730Z"">6.42pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>13th over: Pakistan 79-7 (Tanvir 3, Anwar 1) Target 161</strong> If you refresh the page, our Pictures Editor Steve Bloor has stuck a screengrab of that run-out in the wicket entry; I strongly recommend having a look for yourself. Tanvir replaces Maqsood after a very nice bit of teamwork between Moeen and Billings removes the latter, then Morgan is very close to getting rid of the new man: Tanvir went for the reverse sweep and got a top-edge, with the ball just flicking the England captain’s fingertips as he dived desperately towards leg slip.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5657515ce4b0d1c309bdaaea"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T18:38:14.703Z"">6.38pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Wicket!

Vince actually gets off the mark this time, flipping a short ball through square leg on the pull but seeing it fielded nicely on the bounce to keep the batsmen to one. Morgan works another single to midwicket to get off the mark himself before Vince charges at a straight one and misses completely with an attempted swish over mid off. He does connect with the final ball, standing tall, walking towards it and slapping it past the diving fielder, through extra cover for four.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56573128e4b0e0f1bc262209"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T16:21:24.207Z"">4.21pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>4th over: England 19-3 (Vince 0, Morgan 0)</strong> Vince is off the mark with a scrambled single, taken after yet another leading edge while trying to work it to leg.

He middles a similar shot a couple of balls later, but picks out the fielder to give up a third early, easy catch. Out comes the England captain who, despite having bumped himself down the order, is in the middle much earlier than he would have expected.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-26T16:22:23.486Z"">at 4.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5657304ae4b0d1c309bdaa80"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-26T16:19:50.367Z"">4.19pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Wicket!

The three T20s may be expected to fetch the biggest crowds of the series but there is an argument to be made that, in this country at least, this is the least-loved format of the game. It’s the low-key end to a slightly alien-feeling tour that few people here have actually given much of a thought about. These next three OBOs might well be published in the next edition of the OED next to “perfunctory”. Honestly, why even bother?</p> <p><strong>Well, er, not quite.</strong> In fact we are in the perhaps unique situation for English cricket where the T20s, tacked on at the end as they may be, are in fact the most important leg of the tour. We learned little from the Tests that will stand us in good stead for a tour to South Africa or the next two series, in home conditions against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Winning an ODI series here is scant preparation for the next two ICC events, both of which will take place back in England. But then the World T20? That’s in India (well, somewhere in India) next March and, though this isn’t the subcontinent, the conditions aren’t a <em>million</em> miles away.</p> <p><strong>Since the most recent of English cricket’s nadirs</strong> (could any other sporting team in the world be the subject of that sentence?), the defeat to the Netherlands in the 2014 World T20, they have played just four matches in this format. They’ve won the last three, but only Papua New Guinea have played fewer. After these three matches, they have just two more, both in South Africa in February, so time is short and wouldn’t a continuation of that winning streak be just dandy?</p> <p><strong>The good news for England is that their side already looks pretty settled.</strong> James Taylor, arguably the biggest success story of the tour, has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVrVY540xdc"">lived David Byrne’s dream and gone home</a>, so James Vince could make his debut here, but other than that we shouldn’t expect too many changes from the side that went unchanged through the ODIs. If they can carry on the improvements they showed throughout that series, with the bat especially, you’d imagine they’ll be just fine on <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/25/england-pakistan-twenty20-dubai-eoin-morgan"">what’s expected to be a flat wicket here in Dubai</a>.</p> <p><strong>Play begins at 4pm GMT, </strong>which is 8pm local time. I’ll have toss and team news around half an hour before then, I would expect. In the meantime, well, just stick that Talking Heads song on loop. I’m not going to be able to give you anything better.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-26T10:36:46.347Z"">at 10.36am GMT</time></p>  </div>"

We’ve never taken a backward step since we’ve come together as a squad. As long as that continues and we’re really honest with ourselves and learn along the way, that will hold us in good stead for the T20 World Cup.”</p> <p>For the moment the focus is on Pakistan, ranked No2 in the world as opposed to England’s No8. James Taylor and Jonny Bairstow have gone home, their places having been taken by James Vince and Stephen Parry, but the team for the first match is likely to be very similar to the one that played in all the 50-over matches. However, Morgan indicated that he would like to give most members of the squad an outing before the series is over.</p> <p>There are more changes within the Pakistan lineup. Shahid Afridi, 35 years of age, is their captain, 19 years after he made his international debut. The expectation now is that Afridi’s bowling is more effective than his batting, but he still has the capacity to surprise and inspire. Another veteran of this format, Sohail Tanvir, returns to give Pakistan a triumvirate of contrasting left-armers, alongside Mohammad Irfan and Wahab Riaz. The mischievous Umar Akmal is back in the squad at the last count.</p> <p>The hope is that these T20 matches, which start at 8pm local time, will generate the largest crowds of the tour at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, which has a capacity of 25,000.</p> <p>England were unable to train at the ground on Wednesday for a very unusual reason. It was drizzling in Dubai, only a dribble by Mancunian standards but enough to force England to change their plans. They were compelled to move to the ICC academy, half a mile away, and to pull rank over their juniors. The youngsters on the performance programme had been scheduled to use the facilities there.</p> <p>An opportunity to meet some of the next generation was illuminating. Clearly they are relishing the chance to enhance their white-ball cricket, which is the focus of attention this winter, and everyone we listened to mentioned Worcestershire’s Ross Whiteley. He may not be the best cricketer in the party but they left us in no doubt that he is the man who hits the ball the furthest, and that obviously impresses his peers. Perhaps this is why Whiteley has hit more sixes than fours in his T20 career.</p> <p>There was also scope for Kent’s Daniel Bell-Drummond to speak eloquently about the proposal to do away with the toss in the second division of the County Championship next summer. The 22-year-old caught the eye last season when hitting a sparkling century against the Australians on a true pitch at Canterbury. In his next game, in July at Grace Road and during which no spinner was required to bowl, he made seven and five on what he described as “the greenest wicket ever”.</p> <p>Bell-Drummond explained how in his second innings: “I ended up having a hack and just got out because I didn’t feel I was going to get anywhere any other way. That is a bit of a shame, but at the same time I understand why counties do it [prepare sub-standard pitches] as they want to get out of the division. But as an opening batsman I do find it tough.”</p> <p>Hence his initial reaction to the proposed change: “It will be brilliant.”</p>"

But while the contest may have been diminished by the margin of victory Buttler provided a stunning demonstration of modern ODI batting, one that very few players on the globe can match.</p> <p>Buttler has now hit the three <a href=""http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/211608.html"" title="""">fastest centuries for England in ODI cricket</a>. Friday night’s staggering innings beat his own record of 61 balls, set <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/31/sri-lanka-hold-nerve-to-withstand-jos-buttlers-assault-for-england"" title="""">against the Sri Lankans at Lord’s in 2014</a>. In their last 10 overs England amassed 129 runs, compared with the 56 they managed from a similar position in <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/13/alex-hales-century-england-pakistan-odi-series"" title="""">the second match in Abu Dhabi</a>.</p> <p>Eoin Morgan had looked on from the balcony watching “the best ODI knock I’ve seen in an England shirt”. “I’m lost for words – though ‘surprise’ is not one I’m looking for. I thought the pitch was a bit two-paced when I was batting but it must have got better,” he quipped.</p> <p>Morgan’s greatest contribution to the victory may have been having the wit to promote Buttler to No4 once the foundation had been laid.</p> <p>Buttler was devastating no matter who was bowling or where they bowled. His second 50 took 16 balls. One moment there was astonishment at the power of his hitting, the next at the audacity and inventiveness of deflections behind the wicket. One six over midwicket off Anwar Ali sailed into the second tier of the stand, the ball travelling about 95 yards. Then he was gliding blameless deliveries over his left shoulder and the wicketkeeper’s head, or reverse-flicking the ball down to the vacant third man region.</p> <p>There was barely any foot movement whatever shot he played but he can hardly be criticised for that. Buttler, like AB de Villiers of South Africa, has transformed how the game is played and there are very few players out there who can emulate how he goes about batting in white-ball cricket. In fact Buttler, speaking so softly for a man who hits the ball so hard, mentioned De Villiers as an inspiration: “He has changed the game completely. Everyone has been watching him and we want to emulate him.” One or two of the shots played by Buttler may not even be in De Villiers’ armoury.</p> <p>The foundation had been laid, mostly by Roy, though he was ably assisted by Joe Root who hit a run-a-ball 71. By comparison Roy’s hundred was unremarkable. It many ways it was, however, more significant. Buttler’s special talent was well known even if it has been latent for a while but Roy had never progressed beyond his shirt number (67) before. Here he entered new territory, posting a hundred, which obviously meant a lot to him. The gulf between 99 and 100 will always remain massive and one of cricket’s absurd idiosyncrasies. So this time Roy made sure that he got to three figures.</p> <p>It has become apparent that Roy places considerable emphasis on energy conservation when batting. He will run the first one quickly – as the textbooks demand – but only if there is a good chance of coming back for a second. He likes, if possible, to stay cool both physically and metaphorically. But when Roy cut a short ball to deep cover for his 100th run he hared down the pitch and just before reaching the other end he leapt high and punched the air with abandon.</p> <p>A coveted landmark had been reached and his status as England’s one-day opener had been cemented, even though Roy’s innings would be overshadowed by Buttler’s. Until last night this was not a ground with many happy memories for England’s keeper. “I feel a bit better than after <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/27/james-taylor-england-jos-buttler-jonny-bairstow-pakistan"" title="""">being dropped following the Test</a>,” said Buttler.</p> <p>Pakistan chased their huge target bravely but the English bowlers, who knew that they would be subjected to an onslaught, just about held their nerve. Morgan was grateful that David Willey snatched two early wickets against flailing batsmen. Adil Rashid picked up three but inevitably they were costly.</p> <p>England’s out-cricket remained firm. Alex Hales on the leg-side boundary dropped one straightforward catch but, to his credit, when two much more difficult chances came his way he grabbed them eagerly.</p> <p>So, as in 2012, after a comprehensive defeat against Pakistan in the Tests England have prevailed in the ODIs.

England’s next series is in South Africa and the next ICC Champions Trophy and World Cup are both happening in England, in 2017 and 2019 respectively (and we thought the Big Three were going to take over cricket). This is a tour that has overlapped with the cricket World Cup, comes on the back of an Ashes summer and has been played at times not entirely England-fan-watching-from-home-friendly.</p> <p><strong>Maybe it’s just me, maybe it’s the stereotypical Englishman’s apathy towards ODIs, </strong>or maybe I’m just in a bad mood as Virgin* Media broadband was down at my other half’s in Manchester yesterday, forcing me to pay £80 to head back to London on a Virgin* train that was 80 minutes late, on our anniversary yesterday evening so I could come into the office at 9am to do this.

Executing the skill-sets. Developing a winning mentality. Dull media speak these things may be, but no one can deny that they’re not explicitly bad things to do.

He did so when he appointed Trevor Bayliss in May (since very few coaches have overseen teams in World Cup finals) and he reiterated a new commitment during his recent visit to the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>So in his eyes victory over Pakistan in the four-match series would not only be satisfactory but also essential. On Friday England play their last 50-overs match of the tour and a win would enable them to take the series 3-1. They now find themselves as the favourites even though they are playing in alien conditions.</p> <p>So far the games have been too one-sided to be memorable. In the first one at Abu Dhabi, England were rusty and nervous and easily beaten. But they have rallied strongly. In the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/17/taylor-buttler-england-win-third-odi-pakistan"" title="""">next two matches England</a> have been disciplined, zealous and increasingly confident. Even better – and this is not always the case after a Test series – they look as if they are enjoying themselves. A substantial influx of specialists helps in that regard. So, too, does the youthful nature of a squad containing one player over 30 – the constant and, I suspect, increasingly glum observer, Liam Plunkett.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/nov/19/ian-bell-batsman-england"">Ian Bell runs out of corners to turn but batsman’s boots will be hard to fill | Mike Selvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the same token Pakistan appear ever more fragile, especially when they are batting. They have been combative when the ball is in the hands of their contrasting left-armers, Mohammad Irfan and Wahab Riaz, and for half an hour in Sharjah their spinners threatened to cause havoc. But in white-ball cricket their batsmen are unlikely to cause too many sleepless nights for any competent bowling attack.</p> <p>Mohammad Hafeez has had a productive six weeks against England’s bowlers. The rest of them, with the exception of Shoaib Malik, have modest records in this form of the game and we are beginning to understand why. In Sharjah their insecurities were highlighted by some chaotic running between the wickets, which caused three run-outs routinely described as “comic” – though not by their coach, Waqar Younis. In this era when there is a coach for just about every facet of the game it remains mildly surprising teams do not employ a running-between-the-wickets coach.</p> <p>By contrast, England’s top five batsmen have all scored a half century in this series and their No6, Jos Buttler, had reached 49 not out when England passed their target in Sharjah. Eoin Morgan regarded that partnership between <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/17/taylor-buttler-england-win-third-odi-pakistan"" title="""">James Taylor and Buttler as a landmark</a> performance.</p> <p>England’s chase appeared to be subsiding and many times in the past in these conditions there has been no stopping the disintegration. But the risk assessment of this pair was superb, so too was the execution of their big shots. And their running between the wickets provided a model for their opponents. Both are quick but they are also precise in their judgment, or at least they were in Sharjah – in the first match in Abu Dhabi Taylor ran Buttler out.</p> <p>Buttler has emerged from a nasty trough by scoring those vital runs in Sharjah and he is candid about his relief. “It’s great to come through that,” he said, “and I think I’ve learned a lot. I hope I can use those experiences to turn it around quicker next time. It’s huge to get the support of the captain and all the team. Everyone has been very supportive, which means a lot.”</p> <p>Clearly Buttler had been weighed down by his loss of form with the bat. “You lose that sense of enjoyment, which is tough because you’ve got the best job in the world really,” he said.</p> <p>Better than most, Buttler must have an idea of what Ian Bell is going through after his omission from the Test squad for South Africa. He said he was shocked by the decision, but added: “That’s the harsh reality of international cricket. It is a performance job. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/31/england-jos-buttler-joe-root-pakistan"" title="""">I’ve just been dropped recently as well</a>.</p> <p>“If you’re not performing that’s the way it goes but Ian is a class player and has been over a long period for England. He’s determined to win his place back, which shows great professionalism. I’m sure he will.”</p> <p>Buttler said there is a desperation to win this ODI series. “We are a young group of guys and it would give us a huge amount of confidence to win this series away from home,” he said.</p> <p>England are likely to stick with the same team for the fourth match in succession. Pakistan are likely to keep shuffling their pack.</p>"

For the moment we must conclude it was the latter as far as England were concerned in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>In their <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/11/pakistan-and-mohammad-hafeez-ease-past-england-despite-morgan-and-taylor"" title="""">first ODI against Pakistan</a>, with the exception of Eoin Morgan, James Taylor and Reece Topley, England were barely mediocre; in their second the same XI almost <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/13/alex-hales-century-england-pakistan-odi-series"" title="""">delivered a flawless performance</a>. In between the two games none of the participating players had practised. Instead they must have listened, then contemplated before galvanising themselves to play in a manner that now gives them a very good chance of winning the series. There are two matches remaining in the 50-over format, one in Sharjah on Tuesday, the other in Dubai on Friday.</p> <p>There was much relief after the victory. The man of the match, Alex Hales, was especially relieved. He has been here for six weeks, dutifully ferrying drinks out to the Test players and then batting in the nets, trying to improve his play against spin bowling, which in the short term will not be much use to him if he goes to South Africa as Alastair Cook’s opening partner. After their <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/07/india-south-africa-first-test-ravindra-jadeja"" title="""">trials on turning tracks in India</a> the South Africans will surely be grateful to return to some fast-bowler friendly pitches back at home.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/13/alex-hales-century-england-pakistan-odi-series"">Alex Hales hits straps and helps England coast to ODI win against Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After hitting his first ODI century on Friday Hales was asked whether he felt that he was now closer to a Test debut. He gave an honest, interesting answer: “I hope so. It’s something I’m trying hard not to think about.” Which provoked the question of whether it is possible to try hard not to think about something. It seems a self-defeating process.</p> <p>Even so Hales’s answer betrayed that he is probably thinking about his Test prospects quite a lot, which is a perfectly natural and understandable thing for him to do. No doubt he would like to become the first Englishman to hit an international century in all three formats of the game, which is a possibility since he is the only one who <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/27/alex-hales-england-sri-lanka-world-t20"" title="""">can boast a T20 hundred</a>.</p> <p>It would be daft to draw too many conclusions after a century on a slow, grey old pitch against a white ball. Technically, the challenge for Hales would be vastly different against a red ball in the hands of Morne Morkel, but at least Hales ticked a few boxes regarding his temperament. He really was due to score some runs; time was ticking by. Yet he remained calm and clear-headed and he delivered. That will have impressed the powers that be.</p> <p>Hales remains the favourite for that opening slot alongside Cook and if he was campaigning for his inclusion (which is not really his style) he might invite the selectors to take note of a modern pathway to Test success. Who is currently the most devastating Test batsman in the world (never mind the ICC rankings)? It has to be Australia’s David Warner who has been mercilessly <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/13/david-warner-double-century-puts-australia-in-control-against-new-zealand"" title="""">demolishing the Kiwi bowlers</a> in the last fortnight. Warner cracked<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/07/australias-burns-and-warner-heap-more-misery-on-new-zealand-bowlers"" title=""""> two centuries in Brisbane</a>, to be followed by a monumental 253 in Perth. How did Warner’s international career take off? Via T20. Hales has the chance to take a similar route into Test cricket.</p> <p>Another relieved man on Friday was Adil Rashid. At last he found a situation any bowler worth his salt relishes: new batsmen under pressure with the asking rate rising. Rashid did not blow this opportunity. He managed to stay more relaxed and exploit the situation. There were fewer loose deliveries as well as evidence that some of the Pakistan batsmen, who have not seen him in the Test series, were unable to pick his googly.</p> <p>So here was a modest gain for Rashid after a torrid fortnight. Currently he may be able to exploit benign circumstances. If the team has worked its way into a strong position he can be dangerous. He is much less likely to retrieve a situation, where his side is in the mire. Add to that Chris Woakes taking his first ODI wicket in 299 balls to be swiftly followed by three more and the squad headed off to the Emirates Golf Club for a Professional Cricketers’ Association event with smiles on their faces. I must dutifully follow them there.</p>"

If I don’t, things go wrong and it’s not the way I play.”</p> <p>This is the inevitable cue for the Pietersen parallel since Roy is South Africa-born – although he came to the UK at the age of 10 – he plays exotic strokes, including the reverse-hit, and he can swagger a bit. Moreover, they have crossed paths at The Oval. Roy has been impressed by KP: “No matter where he’s playing, when the chips are down he still manages to maintain an extremely positive mindset, which is very difficult at international level,” he said.</p> <p>Roy, however, is also fortunate at Surrey to have Kumar Sangakkara as a mentor and he acknowledges: “I think if he [Sangakkara] had been with me the other day when I gave it away on 50 odd he would have been pulling his hair out.”</p> <p>For the moment, opening the batting in one-day cricket is Roy’s thing. “If anyone can master the game of white-ball cricket that’s outstanding, and there’s nothing wrong with being a white-ball specialist,” he says. “There are eight players here who are just white-ball players and I don’t think you have to be good at all formats. If you are then you’re a genius.”</p> <p>Roy plays shots which hint at a touch of genius and leave onlookers gasping with admiration. On Friday there was the reverse-hit, which nearly went for six, off Pakistan’s leg-spinner, Yasir Shah. Then there were two more orthodox strokes, a back-foot drive and a pull shot off Wahab Riaz, which were not within the parameters of ordinary batsmen. It all looked so easy for him and there was also a hint of disdain in the way he dispatched the ball from his presence.</p> <p>Occasionally he is reminiscent of the recently retired Virender Sehwag, both in his strokeplay and his running between the wickets. At the crease he sprints only when absolutely necessary.</p> <p>For Roy, hitting a ball looks an effortless process. On Saturday, along with most of the squad, Roy took part in an enjoyable golf day, where the players were allocated to teams of local players, who all seemed delighted by their company. Those in Roy’s were taken aback when their guest hit a four iron that deposited the ball 250 yards on to a distant green. My guess is Roy would not have wasted any effort to do that. He must be one of those natural all-round sportsmen.</p> <p>As a consequence I was intrigued to watch Roy play in the statutory game of football at the beginning of the training session on Sunday at the Sharjah stadium. My impression was that in another era he would have modelled his game on Jimmy Greaves, Rodney Marsh or Stan Bowles. Once the ball was lost there was not too much evidence of Roy running around feverishly in an attempt to retrieve it. I have a suspicion he would not be Mauricio Pochettino’s type of player – but he may be all right for Trevor Bayliss, if he keeps on scoring runs in the manner of Friday night.</p>"

They like to know what constitutes their best side.</p> <p>But it is better to be in a “How can we possibly leave him out?” frame of mind rather than a “Who the devil can we pick?” pickle. This is where England find themselves at the moment.</p> <p>The next major tournament, the World T20, takes place in March somewhere in India – we still don’t know where, which is a bit of a problem for any fans wanting to go – and England have to pick 15 players. There is plenty of competition for places. There are big players currently absent; Ben Stokes and Steven Finn would reasonably expect to be in the World T20 squad; so might Stuart Broad, Mark Wood and James Taylor.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/27/england-pakistan-second-t20-international-match-report"">England beat Pakistan in thrilling finish to win second T20 and seal series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/11/pakistan-and-mohammad-hafeez-ease-past-england-despite-morgan-and-taylor"" title="""">losing their first ODI</a> in Dubai on 11 November England have since performed with great verve. The team are worth watching with plenty of youth, talent and smiles on parade.</p> <p>They are not flawless, but they are increasingly fearless. The analysts around the world will not just be concentrating on Eoin Morgan, Joe Root and Jos Buttler, but also Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Sam Billings.</p> <p>Before contemplating World Cup glory, it may be time for a caveat. There are many better one-day sides around than Pakistan. They do not possess many batsmen capable of inducing insomnia among the bowling fraternity; their running between the wickets may well inflict premature baldness on their coach, Waqar Younis, and if the ball goes in the wrong direction, ie towards Sohail Tanvir, the fielding is suspect.</p> <p>Even so, England have exhibited unusual confidence, not just in the way that they have played, but also in their selections for the T20 matches. They have not been shy of shuffling their pack and now the games have been won, this seems the most natural thing in the world to have done. A couple of defeats and it would have been a different matter.</p> <p>Buttler’s status within the one-day set-up was confirmed when he <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/27/england-pakistan-second-t20-international-match-report"" title="""">captained the side on Friday</a>, having been omitted on Thursday. He did not look or sound out of place as a captain behind the stumps or behind the microphone. He acknowledged some disappointment at missing <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/26/england-pakistan-twenty20-match-report"" title="""">the first T20</a>.</p> <p>“When you’ve been batting badly for so long you want to play all the time when you’re back in form. But I could see the bigger picture.”</p> <p>Clearly he enjoyed his first taste of captaincy for a long time. “I’ve always been interested in leadership,” he said. “I’ve wondered what would happen if Eoin was injured and in just one game I’ve learned a lot.”</p> <p>Buttler, whom Morgan was eager to promote to the vice-captaincy in one-day cricket, senses many parallels with his captain. “We have calm heads and we are similar in how we think about the game and in our demeanour.”</p> <p>Both are committed to a free approach to white-ball cricket.</p> <p>“We are retaining that fearlessness and perhaps our lack of experience is helping us,” said Buttler. “We are enjoying the big occasion.” (The last two matches with capacity crowds in Dubai have felt like big occasions.)</p> <p>Buttler, however soft-spoken, will have an increasing influence on the decisions on the horizon. One of these may involve Liam Plunkett, who has taken six wickets in the two T20 matches, games he did not expect to play in. Out of the pacemen Buttler turned to him first when he needed a wicket on Friday night.</p> <p>Plunkett highlights the selectorial dilemma nicely. He was left out of the Test squad for South Africa as Chris Jordan was preferred. Quite rightly, he does not completely hide his frustrations. “I’ve been here seven to eight weeks now and feel like I’ve worked hard on my game and my fitness. I feel like I’m in good nick. I’m gutted not to be going to South Africa for the Test tour. I’ll try to catch the coach later and see if I’ve done something wrong or what I need to improve upon. But you can’t dwell on it,” he said without entirely disguising that his disappointment will linger for a while.</p> <p>Yet on current evidence, even if some of the UAE absentees are recalled, it seems unlikely that Plunkett will be ignored when the next white-ball squads are announced. But who will they omit in his stead? Yes, those selectors have some nice problems on the horizon.</p>"

A mile down the road Rory Mcllroy was winning golf’s Race to Dubai. Amid the ubiquitous pale sand of the suburbs and the building sites the grass on the outfield was just as green as the fairways down the road.</p> <p>There were an awful lot of English cricketers careering around the outfield as the T20 squad, which includes James Vince and Stephen Parry but not James Taylor or Jonny Bairstow, combined with the youngsters of the England Performance Programme. This particular performance group was composed of batsmen and spin bowlers; the fast bowlers arrive from Potchefstroom, South Africa, shortly and in December there will be some T20 matches against Pakistan A.</p> <p>Here ECB coaches could have a little reunion. Andy Flower, Peter Such, Graham Thorpe and Chas Taylor could swap notes with Ottis Gibson, Bruce French and Trevor Bayliss. Indeed one felt for the recently arrived Bayliss. Surely he could have done with some name tags on the shirts of players from the EPP group because it is not great for morale if a young cricketer comes away with the feeling “I’m sure he didn’t have a clue who I was”. By the same token Bayliss might be excused for mixing up his Tom Westley with his Ross Whiteley (not that he did).</p> <p>This was a reminder of the resources available to the development of England’s young cricketers, which can be matched only by those of India and Australia. There they were under another cloudless sky batting, bowling and fielding, on the “pathway” which is designed to take them to the top. It was all faintly reminiscent of a scene in Chariots of Fire, the one where the Americans, rather than the British, were all too zealously going through their training routines in preparation for the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>Reece Topley, right, even though he is only 21, has been on the pathway for a while and it has taken him rapidly into the England one-day side. Topley has already done the rounds: he has represented the under-19s; he has been fast-tracked to the Lions squad; he has had his stress fracture, which is almost a rite of passage for a young fast bowler.</p> <p>Reece is the son of Don Topley, who played for Essex for a decade. In the four ODIs against Pakistan he was England’s most economical bowler – if we discount Joe Root’s three overs – and he has impressed. Sometimes he has swung the new ball; later in the innings he has had the wit and composure to bowl a variety of cutters. He speaks the right lingo too: “All the experience I’ve had from the England pathways and academies has been valuable and I’ve been able to put it into practice.”</p> <p>Topley would not have been considered for the Test squad for South Africa; his current role at this level is restricted to a white ball. But that is not how he wants it to be in the future. “I originally started playing for Essex in red-ball cricket and then it just happened that I was playing more with a white ball and, with more emphasis on that side of the game, my white-ball skills took off. I felt I learnt quickly and it overtook my red-ball ability but I still have a massive passion for first-class cricket and it would be an absolute demon hanging over me if I was to be labelled a one-day bowler. I like to think I’m not.”</p> <p>For a variety of reasons Topley played only two first-class games for Essex last summer but that will be two more than in 2016 because he has decided to move to Hampshire. Here is further evidence of the increasing gap between the two divisions and the thought processes of ambitious, young English cricketers.</p> <p>“You want to test yourself against the best,” said Topley, “and the way it’s going you’re better off playing in the first division at the highest standard of cricket and on a Test ground where I feel it would put a higher value on your wickets.”</p> <p>His current dream is to make England’s T20 World Cup squad. Preparations for that tournament, which takes place in India in March, continue earnestly with England playing a “friendly” match against the UAE on Monday here to be followed by three T20 internationals against Pakistan.</p>"

At least let us hope that is the case.</p> <p>The UAE, not the same force as when they qualified for the last World Cup, provided the practice as best they could. In an almost deserted stadium, expensively lit by thousands of bulbs at the top of four massive pylons, England, even though decelerating rapidly in the second half of their innings, hit 174 in their 20 overs and cantered to a win by 79 runs. Earlier in their warm-up game Pakistan had beaten Hong Kong by 64 runs in daylight in Dubai, a far more environmentally-friendly encounter.</p> <p>This was handy preparation for the three imminent matches, but no more than that. Sam Billings, a man inclined to take the positives, and whose last match was over two months ago, spoke for many of his team-mates when he said: “It was good to have a run-out and dust off the cobwebs. It’s an important week for the team. The T20 World Cup is coming up [in March] and it does not get any bigger than that.”</p> <p>Billings kept wicket more than adequately in Jos Buttler’s absence but could not quite match his batting. “The bloke’s a freak”, he said affectionately when asked about <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/20/jos-buttler-england-pakistan-odi-match-report"" title="""">Buttler’s 64-ball century in the final ODI</a>.</p> <p>An England team has seldom played in front of so few people – certainly not in their own country – and that is just about official. The ECB has released figures that more people attended cricket matches in England in 2015 (2,328,764 of them apparently) than in any year since it was founded in 1997.</p> <p>England gave as many of their bystanders an outing as possible but none could do much with the bat outside the confines of a net. The recent stalwarts scored most of the runs. Jason Roy demonstrated he is in the pink, hitting 59 from 29 balls, and Alex Hales cracked a few boundaries but the rest struggled to have an impact on a surface that became increasingly tricky to bat on.</p> <p>James Vince, flown out specifically for the T20 leg of the tour, was run out for two; Billings mustered a dirty dozen and for a while Chris Jordan swished only at thin air in the closing overs as the UAE contained England to a respectable total.</p> <p>But the hosts never threatened to get close to that target. England’s pace bowlers gathered wickets at will, though Liam Plunkett, who has traipsed around the country for the last seven weeks ferrying drinks and bowling in the nets, was the most expensive. So he may well have to sit out yet again when the T20 team to play Pakistan on Thursday is selected.</p> <p>Stephen Parry, the left-arm spinner from Lancashire who specialises in white-ball cricket even for his county, took a wicket, albeit an ugly one – a big full toss was hoicked to deep midwicket. Somehow Moeen Ali finished with four for 11.</p> <p>It was a surreal affair, which attracted very little attention in these parts and which was of limited value. At the end of it all the teams shook hands warmly but those in the stadium, whether players, press or indeed the odd spectator, must have wondered for a second or two what they were doing there. It should be a little more animated come Thursday.</p>"

The EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 <a href=""http://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/attachments/endingaffair_briefing_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">reflected this</a>, not just lacking ambition but prioritising the competitiveness of the very industries causing climate change.</p> <p>The result is that governments are afraid to tackle climate change for fear of upsetting industry, or when they do, polluting industries are given <a href=""http://corporateeurope.org/environment/2015/10/eu-emissions-trading-5-reasons-scrap-ets"" rel=""nofollow"">huge taxpayer-funded handouts</a>.<br /></p> <p>The oil industry would have you believe that natural gas – fracked or otherwise – is the future of clean energy, despite evidence showing that methane leakage during the extraction process can cause more damage to the atmosphere than coal.<br /></p> <p>In reality, it is an attempt by the oil industry to remain relevant in a world where at least 80% of fossil fuels need to remain in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change.<br /></p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Read between the lines and it’s actually a fight over regulation: do we leave it to business to choose?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes <a href=""http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175873/tomgram%3A_naomi_oreskes,_a_%22green%22_bridge_to_hell/"" rel=""nofollow"">is blunt</a> about the issue. The dash for gas, she says, will “simply increase the total amount of fossil fuels available to burn, accelerating what is already beginning to look like a rush towards disaster.”<br /></p> <p>Industry chiefs argue that putting a price on carbon and making polluters pay for emissions will transform business models. However, ExxonMobil has put an internal price on carbon, <a href=""https://www.cdp.net/CDPResults/global-price-on-carbon-report-2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">between $60 and $80 a tonne</a>, and they’re still investing in fossil fuels.</p> <h2>What is the role of business?</h2> <p>Read between the lines and much of the issue at hand is in fact a fight over regulation: do we leave it to business to choose the lowest priced emissions reductions based on a market price, regardless of the consequences? Or do we want policies supporting renewable energy or energy efficiency, regardless of whether big business believes they are the cheapest option?<br /></p> <p>Tackling climate change means drastically transforming our economies. Governments, not markets, are best placed to do that. The phrase on the lips of many corporate lobbyists is “net-zero emissions”, which means that rather than eradicating all emissions, some can continue while experimental and untested technologies can remove CO2 from the atmosphere elsewhere.</p> <p>Shell interprets it as a green light to burn fossil fuels <a href=""http://blogs.shell.com/climatechange/2015/06/fourdemands/"" rel=""nofollow"">until the end of the century</a>. But most negative-emissions strategies require huge amounts of land to sequester carbon, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimating it would require up to <a href=""http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/caught_in_the_net_actionaid.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">twice the landmass of Africa</a> to stay below 2C.<br /></p> <p>In the real world, “net-zero” gives polluters an excuse to continue with business as usual, claiming that future inventions will fix the problem.</p> <p>Expect to hear about the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture in Paris. It is supposed to help small farmers adapt to climate change while reducing emissions, but has been hijacked by synthetic fertiliser companies like Yara and Monsanto.<br /></p> <p>The refusal to define what “climate smart agriculture” is has allowed agribusiness to add a new green tint to business as usual, pushing the same practices that have led to deforestation, land grabs, biodiversity loss and soaring emissions.<br /></p> <p>More than <a href=""http://www.climatesmartagconcerns.info/english1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">350 civil society groups</a> are calling on COP21 to reject the concept and the Alliance, labelling it “green-washed false solutions”. At COP21 the <a href=""http://climateaction.unfccc.int/about-lpaa"" rel=""nofollow"">Lima-Paris Action Agenda</a> will hold up the cosmetic commitments from the likes of Shell and BP alongside the weak government agreement to hide the lack of ambition.</p> <p>Many gave up hope a long time ago that Paris would deliver. But it could still be a step in the right direction. Hundreds of thousands have already <a href=""http://kickbigpollutersout.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">added their name</a> to campaigns urging governments to recognise the damaging influence “big polluters” have over climate policy, and to kick them out of COP21 and all levels of government.</p> <p>If enough people get behind it, Paris could mark a watershed moment: the beginning of the end for the cosy affair between politicians and polluters.</p>"

Ishaq was killed in a gun battle that supposedly erupted while police were taking him to identify an arms cache.</p> <p>The extreme measures taken against LeJ underline a profound change of attitude on the part of the Pakistani state towards some of the country’s militant groups. In the past Ishaq had been able to act with near impunity because violent Islamist groups such as LeJ were part of the wider network of jihadi groups encouraged to fight in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In the last 18 months, however, the state has set out to crush those groups that have turned their guns on domestic targets, including religious minorities.</p> <p>Khaled Ahmed, a longstanding critic of the security establishment’s use of jihadi groups, said the killings in Lahore were a significant development. “A decision has been made by the army to act against these elements who have been always attached to the army in the past,” he said, crediting the policy change to Raheel Sharif, the general who took command of Pakistan’s all-powerful army in 2013. “I think this general is all for shutting shop on these non-state actors.”</p> <p>In July intelligence chiefs warned the government that LeJ was poised for a potential merger with Isis, which has not yet been able to develop a firm support base in Pakistan.</p> <p>Analysts say Pakistan’s civilian government backs the tough stance against LeJ despite fears in the past of provoking an organisation with a powerful base in Punjab, the province from where the ruling Pakistan Muslim League draws most of its support.</p> <p>A leading figure in the party, the Punjab home minister Shuja Khanzada, was killed in a bomb attack in April, widely seen as a revenge for the killing of Ishaq.</p>"

But that is not the only disparity in the way the east and west reacts in the face of terrorist attacks. When terror strikes the west, it is rare that just tears flow. The blood of those we bomb flows, too.</p> <p>Like many, I shed tears for Paris. I have lived there and spent much of the weekend grieving with friends who know and love the city. But our grief was interrupted by a declaration of what French president François Hollande <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/13/shootings-reported-in-eastern-paris-live"">called</a> a “pitiless war”. Blood was being demanded.<br /></p> <p>Hollande <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/world/europe/paris-terror-attack.html?_r=0"">said</a>: “Terrorism will not destroy the Republic, because the Republic will destroy it.”</p> <p>His first statement is correct. Terrorism will not destroy France; Isis’s black flag will never fly over the Assemblée Nationale. As foreign policy expert <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/stephen-m-walt"">Stephen M Walt</a> recently <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/isis-revolutionary-state"">argued</a> in Foreign Affairs, Isis neither has an ideology contagious enough to topple stable governments through popular revolution, nor the firepower to spread its ideas through conquest. Isis, in other words, poses no existential threat to the western world. </p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/17/terror-cooperation-paris-attack-response-war-isis"">Terror can only succeed with our cooperation | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for Hollande’s boast that France will destroy Isis, history tells us that he will be sorely mistaken. Isis – especially the ideology that motivates its members – cannot be eradicated through bombs. That is why the world is trying to reach a negotiated ceasefire and peace in Syria: we know that the best way to contain Isis is to restore peace to the few tumultuous places in the Middle East where it has established a quasi-state.</p> <p>Hollande’s belligerent response – <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/16/france-launches-massive-airstrike-on-isis-stronghold-in-syria-after-paris-attack"">dropping 20 bombs on Raqqa </a>on Sunday alone – will not protect France from further terrorist attacks, especially when they are planned in <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/17/terrorists-belgium-paris-attacks"">neighboring Belgium</a>. Nor will it rid the world of Isis. So why has the French leader responded to violence with more violence? </p> <p>What happened in Paris has been described as a “<a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/paris-terror-attacks-the-lessons-of-mumbai-were-learned-by-the-jihadis-a6734836.html"">Mumbai-style attack</a>”, but it did not provoke a Mumbai-style response.

We worried that there would once again be <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/17/world/riot-scars-are-gone-but-bombay-is-still-healing.html?pagewanted=all"">communal violence between Muslims and Hindus on the streets</a>; we dreaded the thought that politicians would exploit the attacks to foment suspicion between people in our diverse country, in which people of different religious, language and ethnic groups all live together.</p> <p>Then-Prime Minister Manhmohan Singh instead responded with <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/opinion/15fri2.html"">admirable restraint.</a> The attackers were <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/30/mumbai-terror-attacks-india3"">all</a> Pakistanis, who had trained in Pakistan and whose handlers were instructing them during the attack from the other side of the border. Yet, when the then prime minister addressed the grieving nation, he refused to order military strikes against that country.</p> <p>Thanks to Singh’s restraint in the face of public grief and shock, war with Pakistan was avoided. It was for the best. Places of conflict and turmoil are breeding grounds for terrorist groups, and any Indian attack on Pakistan would have only increased the appeal of terrorism among some young men in the region. <br /></p> <p>Yes, there have been more attacks in India since 2008.

But they can. By deepening France’s involvement in the conflict, Hollande risks giving Isis more firepower for their propaganda campaign, which decries western “crusaders” invading Middle Eastern lands. <br /></p> <p>The French president must remember those assuring words he delivered to his own nation: “Terrorism will not destroy the Republic.” I would go further and say terrorism has not and will not destroy any of the stable nations that have had the misfortune of experiencing it. <br /></p> <p>Mumbai jumped back on its feet after the 2008 attack and experienced many moments of joy and triumph. In 2011, India <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/02/india-sri-lanka-cricket-live"">won</a> the cricket world cup finals that were held in the city. The streets through which people had once run with fear at the sound of bullets and grenade explosions were filled with jubilation. Indians, both Muslims and Hindus, celebrated that night. And that was the greatest victory of all against the terrorists: unity.<br /></p>"

Then it all becomes a bit fuzzy, although Plunkett may not see it in such gentle terms.</p> <p>Unlike Chris Woakes, Mark Footitt and Chris Jordan, all of whom are going to South Africa, Plunkett was in the Test squad in the United Arab Emirates but he is not required any longer. He has kept his counsel rather well but Jason Gillespie, Plunkett’s coach and mentor at Yorkshire, has let on that he is none too happy.</p> <p>“I know he is bitterly disappointed”, Gillespie says. “We were left scratching our heads a little bit at Yorkshire. He has gone from almost playing to not in the squad in conditions you think might suit him – fast, bouncy wickets; he is one of the fastest bowlers in the country so that is an interesting one.”</p> <p>The selection of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/19/engalnd-test-squad-south-africa-ian-bell"" title="""">Woakes for South Africa</a> was no great surprise; he is a dependable cricketer and is the man most capable of acting as cover for Ben Stokes, now recovering from his shoulder injury. Footitt, though representing a bit of a gamble, at least offers welcome variety. So the final place must have rested between Plunkett and Jordan. They plumped for Jordan, who until the friendly against the UAE on Monday, has been sighted here only as a substitute fielder, often at deep midwicket. (This prompted a neat observation below the line on the Guardian website when England were playing their ODI in Sharjah – “Sarfraz tried to hit the ball into Yemen but could only reach Jordan.”)</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/23/adelaide-oval-on-track-to-be-ready-for-pink-ball-test-after-acdc-concert"">Adelaide Oval on track to be ready for pink ball Test after AC/DC concert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After he had bowled <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/23/england-uae-t20-cricket-match-report"" title="""">handily against the UAE</a> Jordan said he was overjoyed to be selected for South Africa, though the news had obviously come as a bit of a surprise. He explained he had been considering playing in the Bangladesh Premier League before his winter took a turn for the better. He was confident “you haven’t seen the best of me as a Test cricketer” (he has played eight Tests) and said he was now in great shape after injuries this year. It was suggested he was a bit rusty with the bat against the UAE when he swished at a lot of hot air. “A lot rusty,” he corrected.</p> <p>So Jordan has his chance to impress but the reservoir does not end with him.

Unlike Jordan, both have played all the ODIs here and will expect to start in the T20 team.</p> <p>Then beyond this batch there are two sets of brothers, who should be challenging strongly before too long: the England and Wales Cricket Board coaches are keeping their eyes on the Overtons (Craig and Jamie), who came to Somerset via north Devon and the Currans (Tom and Sam), who arrived at Surrey via Durban and Wellington college. At least two of them could disturb a fragile pecking order quite soon. For the moment I’ll hedge my bets about which ones.</p>"

This image of teenagers – still of school age, wielding automatic weapons to kill scores of people – is deeply shocking.</p> <p>So far, the only attacker who has been fully identified was 29 years old, and it is unclear if the witnesses’ descriptions of other terrorists is accurate. But their apparent youth would fit an emerging picture of those attracted to Islamic State’s ideology and – perhaps more importantly – the twisted “gangsta-jihadi lifestyle” some believe it offers.</p> <p>One trend of recent years in Islamic militancy has been the shift from foreigners launching an attack in the west – such as the 9/11 attacks – to so-called “homegrown” extremists. We still don’t know where all the Paris attackers came from, and this is hugely important in determining the nature of the threat going forward.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/police-question-paris-attacker-family"">Police question Paris attacker's family as investigation widens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But another trend is the youth of those involved in militancy. A decade ago in the UK, the presence of a schoolboy in an extremist network was seen as extraordinary. Many remarked on the presence of a 19-year-old among the suicide bombers who attacked London in 2005. Since then, however, teenage terrorists and fighters have become unexceptional. </p> <p>If it is often older militants who engage in violence in their home countries; the average age of Europeans heading to Syria to fight with Isis appears significantly lower than that of the volunteers who travelled to Afghanistan to train with the Taliban or al-Qaida. Hundreds are barely old enough to vote.</p> <p>Why is this? One reason is practical. Al-Qaida and most of its affiliates have always been based in remote places, such as western Pakistan, that are hard to reach, and harder to leave. You needed to be committed, connected and resourceful to get there, and be prepared not to come out. Communication was limited, food bad, accommodation worse, celibacy assured and the risk of capture, injury or death was high. MI5 overheard British volunteers who made it to Pakistan complaining of boredom and chronic stomach upsets. Such a journey was not something undertaken on the spur of the moment by an impulsive teenager and his friends.</p> <p>In contrast, taking part in what was famously described as a “five-star jihad” in Syria required much less commitment. Reaching and leaving the conflict zone has been, until recently, relatively easy. The suspected mastermind of a Belgian Isis-linked cell that plotted a complex attack earlier this year <a href=""http://www.egmontinstitute.be/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/academia-egmont.papers.75_16x24.pdf"">dubbed himself a “terrorist tourist” in a clip</a> found on his mobile phone.

The older group’s videos usually involve a lengthy monologue in Arabic reminding Muslims of their various jihadi duties and little else. Isis propaganda films targeting western teenagers comprise short clips resembling a <a href=""http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/ResearchNote_20_Zelin.pdf"">cross between a video game and a trailer for an action movie</a>. </p> <p>The propaganda also promises weapons, camaraderie and excitement. Publications such as the multilingual Isis magazine, Dabiq, emphasise sexual opportunity too, either through marriage to another volunteer or rape.

The consensus from the main parties is that the MoD is only recovering from swingeing cuts since 2010 and that new threats from terrorism and from Russia require extra funding. In reality, the MoD’s procurement budget rose in real terms over the last five years and the only major equipment casualty was the Nimrod patrol aircraft that was plagued by technical problems and not fit to fly. Since then, every programme has been funded, including over £20bn for Trident and now a similar amount for the combined aircraft carrier and F35 fighter order. None of this provides real security.

These are indicators of the big climate problem we are creating for ourselves, and set the tone of great urgency for the negotiators in Paris to make a meaningful agreement that will put us on the road of greenhouse gas emission reductions and elimination that will limit climate change to an amount that we can probably cope with.”</p>"

However, she is far from being the first female suicide bomber. <br /></p> <p>There have been female terrorist suicide attackers for decades. They were dispatched by secular, leftist organisations in the 1980s in Lebanon, and by ethno-separatist groups such as the Kurdish PKK and the Tamil LTTE in Sri Lanka in the 1990s. A Tamil female suicide bomber assassinated the Indian prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991.</p> <p>In 2000, Chechen groups began launching suicide attacks by women. So-called “<a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/7534464/Moscow-bombing-who-are-the-Black-Widows.html"">black widows</a>” – many were indeed the wives of men who had died in the conflict with Russian forces – were involved in a series of spectacular terrorist actions. These have continued.</p> <p>Between 2002 and 2005, women also took part in a wave of suicide attacks launched by Palestinian militant groups against Israeli targets. </p> <p>The central command of al-Qaida, which has been shouldered out of its former position of pre-eminence among Islamist militant organisations by Islamic State, avoided the use of women as suicide attackers on its high-profile spectacular operations. However, affiliated groups have deployed them.</p> <p>In 2005, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida"">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, the Jordanian former street thug turned militant who led the al-Qaida affiliate in Iraq, sent four suicide bombers including a woman to attack weddings in luxury hotels in Amman, the capital of his homeland. </p> <p>The attacks killed 60 people and prompted outrage in Jordan (and apparently deep concern among the al-Qaida high command). A filmed confession by the woman, who was detained when she failed to detonate her device, contributed to a growing wave of revulsion towards al-Qaida in the region and beyond which had significant strategic consequences for the group.</p> <p>That same year, the first-known European woman, a Belgian married to an Algerian-born Islamist, died in a bombing targeting a US convoy in Iraq. Affiliates elsewhere, such as in central Asia and the horn of Africa, went on to use, <a draggable=""true"" href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/06/female-suicide-bombers-are-not-a-new-phenomenon/"">albeit sparingly, female suicide attackers</a>. They have remained rare however, particularly in Pakistan and Afghanistan. </p> <p>The most intensive user of female attackers has been the Nigerian-based group Boko Haram, the leader of which swore allegiance to Isis earlier this year. Just over two months ago <a draggable=""true"" href=""http://www.voanews.com/content/twin-blasts-in-ne-nigeria-mosque-kill-dozens/3009865.html"">four female suicide bombers killed dozens of people at mosques in north-east Nigeria</a>. They were the latest in a wave of women sent against civilian targets in the area. Dozens of women have been used as bombers by the group over the past eight months. Some were children, as young as 10 years old.</p> <p>Suicide bombers are a choice by an organisation – not necessarily a cheap one. It requires significant investment to psychologically condition suicide bombers, equip them and to maintain them at the pitch of commitment necessary for them to carry out their mission. Al-Qaida, Isis and groups like Hamas have set up entire infrastructures involving special accommodation, hand-picked commanders and even better food to groom their bombers who, even if they are usually volunteers, need careful handling.</p> <p>The advantage of using female suicide bombers for an organisation can be simply tactical – they can avoid suspicion more easily, or can pose as a one half of a couple – or strategic.</p> <p>Terrorists aim to spin out media coverage as long as possible. They know now that after the initial attack will come a hunt, and then, probably, a last stand. Their aim all along is to shock, awe, terrorise, and to attract as much attention as possible. Using women is one very effective way of achieving all these objectives.</p>"

In the fight game, it’s Puerto Rico v Mexico, a long-running international feud that over time has realized the mad valor and savage beauty of this cruel trade more completely than any other.</p> <p>There have been nearly five dozen world championship bouts between fighters from these boxing-mad Latin American nations through the years, and there’s every reason to expect Saturday’s showdown between Cotto and Alvarez, two of the sport’s biggest attractions today, will rate favorably with past classics, taking a place among the rarified air of Salvador Sanchez v Wilfredo Gomez, Julio Cesar Chavez v Hector Camacho, Jose Luis Ramirez v Edwin Rosaro and Felix Trinidad v Fernando Vargas.</p> <p>Cotto (40-4, 33 KOs), who last year became the only Puerto Rican fighter to capture world titles in four weight classes, is coming off a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/06/miguel-cotto-destroys-daniel-geale-and-calls-for-superfight-with-canelo-alvarez"">third-round TKO of Daniel Geale</a> in defense of the WBC middleweight title he won from Sergio Martinez. That victory also made him the lineal champion at 160lbs.</p> <p>Alvarez (45-1-1, 32 KOs) is fresh off a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/may/09/canelo-alvarez-v-james-kirkland-live"">three-round destruction of James Kirkland</a> in May. The red-headed son of a Guadalajara ice-cream vendor, whose lone career setback was a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/15/floyd-mayweather-beats-canelo-alvarez"">points loss to Floyd Mayweather</a> in 2013 that did little to diminish his runaway stock, is a former junior middleweight champion with victories over Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, Alfredo Angulo and Shane Mosley on his ledger.</p> <p>Cotto is 35, nearer to the end of a surefire Hall of Fame career than the start, but having enjoyed a latter-day resurgence since teaming with seven-times trainer of the year Freddie Roach. Canelo is 25, already a household name with a rock-star-like following in Mexico and on the doorstep of mainstream superstardom abroad.</p> <p>It’s a fight hardly wanting for built-in storylines, one that has fortunately required little bombast from the principals themselves, both soft-spoken types whose preferred language is performance. The rarity of summit meetings like Saturday’s between rival promoters’ top charges – Canelo has been groomed by Golden Boy, Cotto the marquee signing to Jay Z’s nascent Roc Nation Sports – only heightens the sense of occasion.</p> <p>The stylistic matchup between two of this generation’s classiest boxer-punchers is as difficult to read as any major prizefight in recent memory. Cotto is about a 2-1 underdog, though a victory for the seasoned champion against the relatively untested challenger would hardly register as a major upset. </p> <p>What it means beyond Saturday night is even more enticing. The winner will face overwhelming public demand to meet Gennady Golovkin, who reasserted his status as the division’s alpha dog with a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/18/gennady-golovkin-stops-david-lemieux-in-eighth-to-unify-middleweight-titles"">clinical beatdown of David Lemieux last month</a> at Madison Square Garden, adding the Canadian puncher’s IBF middleweight title to his WBA and WBC straps. A blockbuster clash between either Cotto or Canelo and the knockout artist known as Triple G to unify the belts at 160lbs would surely be 2016’s biggest fight.</p> <p>But only after the matter of Saturday’s hotly anticipated semi-final, a treat of a title bout with implications far beyond the ring, is settled.</p> <p>“All I have to say is that I am ready,” Cotto said at Wednesday’s final press conference, scarcely above a whisper and typically to the point. “I know that Canelo is ready too.”</p>"

For Mrs K, the goals are purely altruistic, while for Mr K the carrot of a Pride of Birmingham award is too tempting to pass up. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>Unreported World</strong><br />7.30pm, Channel 4<br /></h2> <p>Marcel Theroux investigates a scarcely believable scandal: on islands off the coast of South Korea, farms producing organic sea salt have been using adults who have mental disabilities as slaves. Theroux meets one man who has just been rescued after three decades of hardship, having been tricked by traffickers into leaving home when he was a teenager.</p> <p>It is shocking that such abuse takes place, but the dark side of South Korea’s apparent prosperity is that social security for disabled people is virtually non-existent. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Adele at the BBC</strong><br />8.30pm, BBC1<br /></h2> <p>Since the release of her debut album in 2008, Adele has transformed from London teen to global phenomenon. With her new single, Hello, the 10-time Grammy winner shattered US records by shifting more than 1m downloads in one week. Airing to coincide with the release of her third album, this one-off slice of home-town glory sees her perform with her band in London, as well as giving Graham Norton the lowdown on her story so far. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>Mercury Prize Live 2015</strong><br />9.30pm, BBC4<br /></h2> <p>Unguessable and always surprising, the Mercury prize is a race in which every horse is an outsider, every card a joker. Occasionally observable themes – landmark work by folk artist, classical musician you have never heard of – emerge, but this year seems fairly mainstream, so who’s going to get it? Ghostpoet, in the mix now twice in four years; Aphex Twin, in a “lifetime achievement” sort of way; Florence for selling loads of records; or lesser-known original talents such as Eska, C Duncan or Soak? No, you’re right, it’ll probably be Jamie xx. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>The Returned<br />9pm, More4<br /></h2> <p>Imagine the smell of damp in that French town. After the flood, the tidemarks remind us of the water’s power to consume, never mind all the dead folk walking about. Tonight, Sandrine hands her daughter over to Pierre, while Adele and Simon’s relationship begins to reheat. As much as a relationship with a dead guy can, anyway. And Julie slowly uncovers Victor/Louis’s part in the whole “dead coming back” scenario after a visit to his ageing father in hospital. A waterlogged plot, but it promises to lead us to dry land eventually. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Lincoln’s Last Day<br />10pm, PBS America<br /></h2> <p>A recreation of president Abraham Lincoln’s final hours before his ill-fated trip to the theatre, the treatment is slightly cheap, with one of those cliched, pulse-quickening soundtracks – but there is some insight. As many people would have turned up that evening to see the president as the play (Our American Cousin); identifying assassin John Wilkes Booth would not have been hard – he was a famous actor; and the anti-Lincoln plotters were effectively subject to torture before execution. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Film Choice<br /></h2> <p><strong>Layer Cake </strong>(Matthew Vaughn, 2004)<strong> </strong>9pm, 5<U+2202></p> <p>One of the roles that must have helped Daniel Craig win his licence to kill, in this he displays a Bondian nonchalance under pressure as a cocaine dealer looking for a way out, and is pretty dapper in a suit, too. Vaughn and scriptwriter JJ Connolly create a deeply murky London underworld that feels more restrained, more authentic and more menacing than the Lock, Stock mob. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Fifty Shades of Grey </strong>(Sam Taylor-Johnson, 2015) 10pm, 1.55am, Sky Movies Premiere</p> <p>EL James’s bestselling bonkbuster comes to the little screen, and what a limp thing it is. Dakota Johnson is student Anastasia, who gets to interview enigmatic billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and is soon getting a guided tour of his luxurious sex dungeon, the “red room of pleasure”. With its clean-cut photography and peculiar absence of Grey’s all-conquering penis, it’s reminiscent of the puppet sex scene in Team America. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today’s best live sport<br /></h2> <p><strong>ODI Cricket: Pakistan v England </strong>The final game of the series from Dubai International Cricket Stadium. 10.30am, Sky Sports 2</p> <p><strong>ATP Tennis: World Tour Finals </strong>Day six action from the tournament at the O2 Arena in London. 2pm, BBC2</p> <p><strong>Championship Football: Middlesbrough v Queens Park Rangers </strong>Action from England’s second tier. 7pm, Sky Sports 1</p> <p><strong>Race Of Champions Nation Cup </strong>Trans-national knockout racing from the Olympic Stadium. 7.30pm, Sky Sports F1</p>"

Here is both a sumptuous Diwali treat and another object lesson in the power of mediated fantasy to overturn anything so piffling or painful as reality: for three hours, this charm offensive successfully returns us to the company of the planet’s most likable fellow.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/may/08/salman-khan-suspended-jail-sentence-special-treatment-for-bollywood-stars"">Salman Khan's suspended sentence shows the extent of stars' VIP treatment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In fact, this is a tale of two Salmans. Old Salman is represented in the personage of Vijay Singh – not the golfer, but a brooding, moustachioed prince with forearms like bedside cabinets, set for an expedient yet loveless marriage with aid worker Maithili (Sonam Kapoor). Prince Vijay has his enemies, however. After an assassination attempt incapacitates him, the court turns to the one individual who resembles the prince to ensure the match proceeds as anticipated: this is Prem (Khan again), a prancing flibbertigibbet with a modicum of acting form from his days in a theatre troupe.</p> <p>If the plot’s familiar, no imagination or expense has been spared in mapping the kingdom it winds through. Writer-director Sooraj R Barjatya has apparently spent the nine years since his last feature finessing this coherent, pleasurable screenplay, while saving a decade’s worth of budgets to blow in one go here. These tunics and saris give the lavish fabrics of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/21/cinderella-disney-branagh-fails-frozen-role-model-test"">Kenneth Branagh’s Cinderella</a> a run for their money; the shimmering Palace of Mirrors – constructed, in defiance of all known health-and-safety guidelines, atop a waterfall – makes much of Spectre look like something on offer in Poundland. </p> <p>Yet we get wit with the glitter. Perhaps inevitably, a princely stick-on moustache goes astray as Prem beds into his new role, and his good-natured yammering causes consternation for uptight courtier Diwan (a terrific Anupam Kher, scattering notes of worryworn humanity like rose petals). Barjatya has a sly, winning way of mixing mythology with modernity: the Prince’s horse-drawn carriage arrives with Forbes magazine in its reading rack, while there are nods to everything from the Ram-Leela legend to Game of Thrones via Roman Holiday.</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd4iNPuRlx4""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vd4iNPuRlx4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Yet as the pre-intermission cliffhanger establishes, Barjatya has something more substantial on his mind – and it’s something he can use Khan’s considerable clout to address: the sorry fate of women in patriarchal societies. Since Prince Vijay is too busy waggling swords to notice his bride-to-be’s discomfort, the sensitive Prem sparks a minor revolution within court, opening up to his fake fiancee in ways the real prince appears incapable of, and re-establishing diplomatic ties with the latter’s scorned sisters. Transforming one dreary state function into a footballing free-for-all, this political progressive puts girls and boys on a level playing field.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/13/hero-review-salman-khan-bollywood-producer-sooraj-pancholi"">Hero review - Salman Khan turns producer for punchbag of an action love-in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That it’s Khan who’s fighting for change makes this doubly special: we’re watching modern cinema’s most rapid and radical modification – mollification, even – of an established star persona. Where Bajrangi Bhaijaan identified maternal qualities in this previously hulking heavyweight, Barjatya’s film wonders whether the actor nicknamed Bhai – brother – could equally be claimed as a sister. In a rhapsodic courtship sequence early in the second half, you catch the star observing the newly liberated Kapoor with genuine awe, and with good reason: for one, nobody has ever appeared more luminous drinking directly from the tap.</p> <p>Perhaps Khan has realised, as have so many action heroes over time, that he can’t play the tough guy forever; that, without some application of sense and sensibility, the relentless flexing of moviestar muscle can appear like so much posturing in the gym mirror. (Or the Palace of Mirrors: whatever it takes for a hero to take a long, hard look at himself.) Khan has surely made his mistakes, not least associating with film-makers who were only ever interested in him for his biceps. Yet these last two movies – bringing the best out of this performer, and everyone around him – constitute a pretty wonderful form of community service.</p>"

We can only shed tears of sorrow for hapless victims. The innocents and the powerless have always been pawns in wider proxy wars, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Haven’t we been here before? Drone attacks in Pakistan, aerial bombardments, home demolitions, extra-judicial killings, detention in the occupied Palestinian territories, rocket attacks and stabbings in Israel, barrel bomb attacks in Syria, suicide attacks in New York, Nairobi, Beirut, London, Paris, and airliner explosions over Sinai and eastern Ukraine. Terror has no religion, race or ethnicity – it is politics that creates fertile grounds for terrorism. Violence begets violence. It is time to address the root causes that nourish terror, namely: poverty, unemployment, Islamophobia, antisemitism, racism, food insecurity, religious void, social injustices, occupations and wars.<br /><strong>Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>• One lesson from the Paris atrocities is the need for proper border and other immigration controls. It is clear that in the current circumstances, the Schengen vision of a borderless Europe is not simply dead but deadly (<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-european-leaders-link-terror-threats-to-immigration"">Report, 14 November</a>).</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-european-leaders-link-terror-threats-to-immigration"">Paris attacks: European leaders link terror threats to immigration</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another lesson is to remind us that the first duty of the state is provide security for its people. That duty falls firmly on the individual European states and not on the Brussels bureaucracy, which is both legally and psychologically incapable of protecting us. A key part of that duty is to vet all people entering their territory to filter out those with hostile intent. Our own security will have to take priority in our dealings with the wave of migrants from the Middle East and Africa. It follows from this that the refugee convention will have to be qualified, so that a state can refuse asylum to any person who does not share its core values. It should be for each state to decide democratically what its values are.</p> <p>Among our core values are: the broad equality of the sexes, public justice, toleration of homosexuals, democracy, freedom to change and reject religion, a spirit of inquiry and freedom of speech. All these stand at odds with the terrorists’ Salafi world view that has its roots in Saudi Arabia.<br /><strong>Otto Inglis</strong><br /><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>• After the terror-instilling events in Paris, it is tempting to retaliate with a counter-attack, preferably of much greater magnitude. History tells us that does not resolve anything. The jihadi at the receiving end will embrace the escalating violence. Their casualties will be revered as martyrs.</p> <p>Another response would be to push for higher degrees of security. It is clear that our enemies are the militant Muslims who want to carry out their jihad. It is a folly to attempt to stop all jihadi, or stop them planning attacks. It would be much more cost-effective to limit their access to weapons by placing more controls on the trade of weapons.</p> <p>Our governments should also consider stopping drone attacks. Reports from our security services clearly indicate that drone warfare has not reduced the threat. Moreover, imagine if foreign powers were to send drones to Britain and kill our people on our streets – would we let that pass?<br /><strong>John Highfield </strong><br />London</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/15/paris-attacker-named-investigation-continues-live-updates"">Paris attacks: police hunt 'dangerous' suspect and brother of Isis attacker – live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>• The Paris attacks demonstrate that we desperately need a new journalism to cover the circumstances in which the world now finds itself – and this includes attitudes towards killings. Throughout the day prior to the attacks, the BBC and the rest of the media put out celebratory coverage of the western bombing of the Syrian city of Raqqa, as it was presumed that Mohammed Emwazi was among the many victims (<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/us-officials-reasonably-certain-that-raqqa-strike-killed-mohammed-emwazi"">Reports</a>, 14 November).</p> <p>This follows months of bombings and so-called targeted assassinations. Killing is horrible. Racist flip-flopping on the horror/acceptance of killing according to ethnic identity of the victims does little for the credibility of the west. Global anti-western violence is now a mass movement. Unless we get honest coverage, acknowledging the real grievances and crimes of empire that are fuelling recruitment, then the situation will simply continue to escalate. <br /><strong>Dr Gavin Lewis</strong><br /><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>• In the same way as progressive people rightly expose the ideology behind Nato’s destruction of countries such as Iraq and Libya, we should also respond to and expose an ideology that enables men to butcher people like animals. In July and October, Isis also slaughtered leftwing demonstrators in Turkey. They are the manifestation of the far right and the British left should have them in their sights. We should not allow them to hide behind a religion, pretend that they are somehow responding to Francois Hollande’s support for fellow jihadi in Syria, or provide any other “yes, but” equivocation.<br /><strong>Peter McKenna</strong><br /><em>Liverpool </em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href=""mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com""><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>"

First of all: a disclaimer. Only the deeply misguided go on about this in any detail. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/30/andy-murray-tyson-fury-bbc-sports-personality-of-year"" title="""">The BBC’s award</a> has always been a mannered affair, with its own distinct tone and texture. When Princess Anne won it in 1971 George Best – yes: that George Best – came second. Joe Calzaghe showed a healthy iconoclasm towards the whole thing when he broke the award shortly after winning it in 2007, his entourage throwing the trophy around “like a rugby ball” until it shattered inside its box.</p> <p>Still there was something genuinely startling this year about the absence of Joe Root from the main shortlist. Let’s face it, there is nothing more Root could have done in his sport this year. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/27/joe-root-england-pakistan-steve-smith-icc-batting-rankings"" title="""">The world No1 Test batsman</a> at the end of an Ashes-winning summer. The new record holder for England runs in a calendar year. A role model professional in what is still technically the national summer sport. But no. Sorry Joe. Not bad but not enough.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/30/andy-murray-tyson-fury-bbc-sports-personality-of-year"">Sports Personality of the Year: Jessica Ennis-Hill, Andy Murray and Tyson Fury among favourites</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not that any of this matters in itself. It is a mistake to omit Root but this doesn’t diminish the achievements of those on the list. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/13/adam-peaty-interview-swimming"" title="""">Adam Peaty</a> and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/31/max-whitlock-louis-smith-world-gymnastics-gold-medal"" title="""">Max Whitlock</a> may not be household names but they too have achieved a gold standard in their sports and deserve every glimmer of credit. Plus, of course, this is the BBC and just as Sky sometimes imagines football began in 1992, so there is a natural weight towards those who exist on its screens.</p> <p>The only real significance of that Root-less list is it feels like a salutary omission for cricket itself, another brushstroke in a wider picture. Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day and it is 10 years since the last cricketer made the BBC top three (Andrew Flintoff, 2005). Beyond that it’s an entire adult lifetime since the golden era from David Steele’s extraordinary victory in 1975, through Geoff Boycott (the runner-up in 1977) to the Botham Years (79-85, with sabbaticals).</p> <p>The days when quite ordinary England cricketers were household names, when Mike Gatting’s (hotly denied) indiscretions were deemed front page (!) news will not come again. Cricket has made its tactical retreat behind the veil of pay-TV. It has, in the words of the proverb, taken what it wanted and paid for it.</p> <p>So here we are. Kids who have pre-converted cricketing parents, or go to one of the minority of schools where cricket is still a thing, know who Joe Root is. To the majority, the floating fans, the untapped devotees of the future, he is simply a shadow presence, a national sporting hero <em>manqué</em>.</p> <p>Which is a terrible shame on two levels. First because Root is a perfect breakout star: brilliant, cheeky, funny, cool. Kids that do know him love him. There are plenty of eight-year-olds out there already aping his batting stance and playing those (infernal) Root-style scoops every other ball.</p> <p>And second because cricket has always needed stars to spread its word. This is a precarious sport, a world away from the easy thrills of football which will always come surging in through every crack and cranny. Cricket is difficult, obscure, academic. It needs easy-access heroes to cut through the complexities, personalities to draw in those who may otherwise be baffled at first by its maths and manners.</p> <p>In this respect visibility is key. It was the relationship with the BBC after the second world war that effectively kept the sport going in this country as a public event, a 61-year monogamous marriage that brought mass ball-by-ball exposure, the Coronation year Ashes, Jim Laker in 1956 (cricket’s first Spoty winner) and the triumph of full-blown Botham-ism in 1981.</p> <p>The decision to shack up with Sky Sports is often treated a little hysterically. It has plenty of hard sense to it. Those who are already fans get more and better TV access than ever before. There is guaranteed money in county cricket to pay for coaches, employees, players’ salaries, development and new (largely empty) stands.</p> <p>The problem is the sustainability of the model. The pre-converted have been cashed in. Where will the future consumers come from? Who will actually play the game outside those who can afford to stumble across it, or have it given to them by the doggedness of the schools and local clubs that still thrive?</p> <p>This is more than simply a mawkish lament for our vanished summers, those lost Roots, the fading glory of a better, more readily accessible televisual world. It is also a commercial problem to be solved. And there are solutions. Test cricket will never be back on terrestrial TV. It’s too long and not enough people watch it. Twenty20 cricket, on the other hand, was conceived as a way of spreading the glow and it could still do this on television.</p> <p>Imagine, if you can, a sport that was willing to concede some of its revenue now for the promise of more jam tomorrow. Just by broadcasting domestic Twenty20 cricket on free to air television, whatever the immediate revenue implications, English cricket could create a hugely valuable connection. This has been key to the success of the Big Bash in Australia. When Alex Hales swatted the Sydney Sixers around the SCG two years ago, when <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/07/ben-stokes-77-melbourne-renegades-england"" title="""">Ben Stokes blitzed the Hurricanes</a> in Hobart earlier this year, it was a shared sporting event in Australia, raising the slightly off possibility that two of England’s most exciting players may have converted more casually spectating non-cricket kids over there than they have over here.</p> <p>In 2010 the IPL was streamed live on YouTube, a loss-leader that drew 50m viewers, 40% of those outside India. So English cricket, in the year of the invisible Root, really might want to consider peeking out from behind the battlements.</p> <p>Right now England have a fantastic Twenty20 team full of young thrusters raised and honed in county cricket. The only sadness is that, like Victorian garden fairies, they’re only there if you want to see them, if you already believe. Root, Jason Roy, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali: imagine a Twenty20 World Cup on free-to-air television – as all world cups should be – where these bold cricketers are allowed to proselytise the game, turn heads, drive sales of bats and balls to the football-sated, and seed the kind of interest that may even foster a return to the front rank. It won’t happen. For commercial, as well as sentimental reasons, it should.</p>"

The experience of the US-led coalition so far, and the counter-terrorist campaign against al-Qaeda before that, offer evidence that at least some of these goals can be achieved. But they also suggest campaigns conducted mainly from the air carry significant risks of backfiring.</p> <p><strong>Will bombing disrupt Isis’s ability to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe?</strong></p> <p>The prime minister’s <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/291209463?access_key=key-wWmOF3IlMYn56JB9fgXx&amp;allow_share=true&amp;escape=false&amp;show_recommendations=false&amp;view_mode=slideshow"">memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee</a>, seeking to address MPs’ scepticism, said: “This military effort helps put Isil [Isis] on the defensive, suppressing their ability to conduct external attacks against the UK and our friends and allies.”</p> <p>The investigation into the Paris attacks showed that at least half the perpetrators had undergone some kind of centrally organised training with Isis.</p> <p>The experience of the fight against al-Qaida suggests that precise targeting of training camps and leaders reduced its capacity to strike western capitals. A trove of documents US navy Seals recovered at Osama bin Laden’s compound showed that drone strikes had made it near impossible for al-Qaida to host and train foreign fighters in the main area under its control, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) in western Pakistan.</p> <p>“This concern about drones affected al-Qaida’s ability to train westerners in Fata, where all the drone strikes have been targeted. It also dissuaded westerners from going to Fata to train,” said Peter Bergen, director of the international security programme of the New America Foundation and author of a series of books on al-Qaida.</p> <p>However, there are also signs that Isis has learned from al-Qaida’s mistakes, and now avoids structured training camps, preferring to live and organise in residential buildings among civilians.</p> <p>“In Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Mosul, Isis is living almost totally among civilians, so you can’t hit them,” said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He pointed out that thousands of foreign jihadists had managed to travel to and from Syria for the past few years through Turkey and questioned the wisdom of now trying to stop jihadists with bombs when they could have been stopped with tighter border controls.</p> <p>The Paris conspirators, including the presumed mastermind, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were able to travel between Belgium, France and Syria while the US-led airstrikes targeting Isis command and control were in full swing.</p> <p><strong>Can bombing contain Isis?</strong></p> <p>In David Cameron’s words: “The coalition’s military strategy aims to stop [Isis’s] advance through the air campaign, to strike them in their heartland and to put them under pressure by continuing to degrade and dismantle their economic and military capability.”</p> <p>US-led airstrikes helped stop Isis capturing key strategic points such as Kobane on the Turkish border, and the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil. In neighbouring Iraq, they were instrumental in preventing the fall of Baghdad when Isis’s power was at its zenith. UK air support also played a role in the liberation of the Iraqi town of Sinjar by Kurdish Peshmerga forces.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism experts say that such defeats damage Isis’s international appeal to foreign jihadists, which depends on the image of a constantly expanding “caliphate”. </p> <p>However, further gains against Isis will require something that has so far eluded the western coalition, a working alliance with other Sunni rebel groups in Syria. Cameron’s memorandum claimed that there are 70,000 Syrian opposition fighters on the ground who do not belong to opposition groups. Experts say the number is credible but note that for most of them, the first priority is to fight the Syrian regime.</p> <p> Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Chatham House thinktank and co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said that persuading other Sunni armed groups to fight Isis as well as the regime may ultimately be the key to success, but that requires a great deal of local knowledge and political commitment.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/nov/27/how-do-you-feel-about-military-action-in-syria"">How do you feel about military action in Syria?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The answer is not dropping more bombs,” Hassan said. “The answer is to find a way to support these groups on the ground. It’s not about money or even weapons. It is about helping them with tactics and an overall strategy that has been missing.”</p> <p>He argued that the expensive US efforts to build an anti-Isis rebel movement failed because it worked with the wrong people and lacked long-term political commitment. The success of any British military contribution, Hassan added, will lie in the UK’s ability to “break out of the constraints” of Washington’s current strategy.</p> <p>The recent emphasis on striking tankers carrying Isis oil exports is likely to dent the group’s vast financial resources but may not affect its immediate fighting capacity. Hassan said Isis scored its most significant victories before it captured the oil fields.</p> <p><strong>Could bombing Isis backfire?</strong></p> <p>Airstrikes on Raqqa on Thursday are reported to have killed at least 12 people, including five children, when bombs fell near a school. It was not clear whether the bombs were dropped by Russian, American or French planes.</p> <p>“The number of civilian casualties from Russian bombardment is far higher than the number caused by American and French airstrikes,” said Wael Aleji, spokesman for the Syrian Network for Human Rights. “This can be attributed to technology. The Russians use more ‘dumb’ bombs and have less advanced guidance systems.”<br /></p> <p>In his memorandum, Cameron pointed to the enhanced precision of the UK’s Brimstone missile as one of the contributions Britain can make to the air campaign. But avoiding civilian casualties will also depend on good intelligence. One of the worst civilian tolls attributed by human rights activists to a US strike was on 1 May <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/02/death-toll-syria-climbs-us-led-air-strike"">near Aleppo</a>, where more than 60 civilians were said to have been killed, perhaps more than half of them children. Abdurrahman said: “We think they got the wrong information. They thought it was Isis, but it wasn’t.”</p> <p>As it becomes harder to find genuine Isis targets, as the terrorist group gets better at melting in with the surrounding population, the civilian toll is likely to rise. And Syrians on the receiving end are unlikely to make the distinction between British warplanes and Russian bombers sent by Assad’s chief ally.</p> <p>“This is likely to generate support for Isis, or at least create indifference among local people,” Hassan said. “These are the risks of unintended consequences.” </p>"

I look at other people in the world and wonder how they become close without climbing! Everything just gets a bit more intense and brighter in that world.

By turning their presence into performance with their cries, they claimed the streets as their theatre – winning the lasting affections of generations of Londoners and embodying the soul of the city in the popular imagination. Through time, the culture of the capital’s street cries became integral to the distinctive identity of London.</p> <p>Undertaking interviews with stallholders in Spitalfields, Brick Lane, Columbia Road and other East End markets in recent years led me to consider the cultural legacy of urban street trading. And while this phenomenon might appear transitory and fleeting, I discovered a venerable tradition in “The Cries of London”: a genre of popular illustrated prints. Yet even these prints, which began in the 17th century, were preceded by verse such as London Lackpenny, attributed to the 15th-century poet John Lydgate, that drew upon an earlier oral culture of hawkers’ cries.

By nature of repetition, these cries acquired a musical quality as hawkers improvised upon the sounds of the words, evolving phrases into songs. Commonly, cries also became unintelligible to those who did not already know what was being sold. Sometimes the outcome was melodic and lyrical, drawing the appreciation of bystanders, and at other times discordant and raucous as hawkers strained their voices to be heard across the longest distance.</p> <p>Over time, certain cries became widely adopted, and it is in written accounts and songbooks that we find the earliest records. Print collections of pictures of criers also became known as “Cries”, and although the oldest set in London dates from around 1600, there are those from Paris which predate these by a century. Characteristically, the Cries represented peripatetic street traders or pedlars, yet other street characters were also included from the start. At first, the Cries were supplemented by the bellman and the town crier, but then preachers, beggars, musicians and performers were added as the notion of the Cries of London became expanded by artists and print sellers seeking greater novelty through elaborating upon the original premise.<br /></p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""4420387a6459a3c7ffbe77e71ca780accbe00173""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/4420387a6459a3c7ffbe77e71ca780accbe00173/60_0_1026_1540/666.jpg"" alt=""“Hair Brooms” outside Shoreditch Church, by William Marshall Craig, 1804."" width=""666"" height=""1000"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Hair Brooms outside Shoreditch Church by William Marshall Craig, 1804.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Courtesy of Bishopsgate Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the age of traffic, the streets of London offered a common public space for all manner of activity, trading, commerce, sport, entertainment and political rallies. Yet this arena of possibility, which is the primary source of the capital’s cultural vitality, has also invited the consistent attention of those who seek policing and social control upon the premise of protecting citizens from each other, guarding against crime and preventing civil unrest. It suits the interest of those who would rule the city that, in London, street traders have always been perceived as equivocal characters with an identity barely distinguished from vagrants. Thus, the suspicion that their itinerant nature facilitated thieving and illicit dealing, or that women might be selling their bodies as as well as their legitimate wares, has never been dispelled.<br /></p> <p>Like the internet, the notion of the street as a space where people may communicate and do business freely can be profoundly threatening to some. It is a tension institutionalised in this country through the issuing of licences to traders, criminalising those denied such official endorsement, while on the continent of Europe the right to sell in the street is automatically granted to every citizen. Depending upon your point of view, the itinerants are those who bring life to the city through their occupation of its streets or they are outcasts who have no place in a developed modern urban environment.<br /></p> <p>When I interviewed Tony Purser on his last afternoon after 52 years selling flowers outside Fenchurch Street Station in the City of London, he admitted to me that as a boy he assisted his father Alfie, and, before licences were granted in 1962, they were both regularly arrested. Their stock was confiscated, they were charged three shillings and spent the night in the cells at Bishopsgate Police Station, before going back to trade again next day.<br /></p> <p>In Brick Lane, until recently, it was possible for casual traders to buy five pounds’ worth of parking tickets from a machine as a day’s licence but, when this was withdrawn, those who had always sold their possessions on the pavement on Sunday mornings found themselves on the wrong side of the regulations. Prior to the opening of a shopping mall of shipping containers for international brands on the former Bishopsgate Goods Yard, I witnessed fly-pitchers in their 80s and 90s being turfed off the pavement by dubious enforcement officers who pilfered the best of their wares.<br /></p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Surely none can resist the romance of the Cries of London, and the raffish appeal of the liberty of vagabondage</p> </blockquote> </aside>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z-4zNyHfA0""                                                                        > <iframe width=""460"" height=""259"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5z-4zNyHfA0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Yet in this part of London, the heartland of markets and street trading, there is a long-held understanding, that those who have no job, no shop or stall have always been able to sell things in the street and make a living for themselves. I know several people who spend their days searching dustbins in the East End and make a living by selling their finds on Brick Lane each Sunday; students who sell off their clothes and textbooks each week to buy groceries. I met a man who sold baked potatoes outside the Tower of London and opened a restaurant that became a chain. I know a spoon carver who sat on the pavement carving spoons until he saved the deposit to rent a shop. Last year, I interviewed a recently-divorced electrician who had his tools taken away and became a directions man, making an income by standing outside Liverpool Street Station and showing visitors the way.<br /></p> <p>Street trading proposes an interpretation of the ancient myth of London as a city paved with gold that is not without truth. Many large British corporate retailers including Tesco (started by Jack Cohen in 1919) and Marks &amp; Spencer (started by Michael Marks in 1884) owe their origin to single stalls in markets – emphasising the value of street trading to wider economic development. Meanwhile, the <a href=""http://oxfordstreet.co.uk/"">Oxford Street Association</a> seeks to rid the pavement of souvenir sellers between the large department stores and the current trend towards the privatisation of public spaces sees the increasing introduction of bylaws restricting trading solely to those legitimised by the property owners.<br /></p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""fb163a98f5bbce2f72ceb04fea11fc2ed82b2987""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/fb163a98f5bbce2f72ceb04fea11fc2ed82b2987/0_0_787_967/407.jpg"" alt=""“Rabbit, rabbit!

Nice fat rabbit!’ by Luke Clennell, 1812.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Courtesy of Bishopsgate Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In particular, it was the story of Tony Hawkins, a licensed pedlar who was arrested 87 times for selling caramelised peanuts in the West End of London, that inspired me to pursue the history and politics of London street trading. On each occasion, Tony was beaten up and had his stock confiscated, even though he had the right to trade under the Pedlars Act of 1871. His experience is a snapshot of the contemporary situation for hawkers, and also a testimony to the ongoing struggle of street traders, who have been consistently marginalised by the authorities in London through the centuries yet managed to thrive and endure regardless, through heroic tenacity and strength of will.<br /></p> <p>In the 20th century, the Cries of London found their way onto cigarette cards, chocolate boxes, biscuit tins, tea towels, silk scarves, dinner services and, famously, tins of Yardley talcum powder from 1912 onwards, becoming divorced from the reality they once represented as time went by, copied and recopied by different artists.<br /></p> <p>Yet the sentimentally cheerful tones applied by hand to prints that were contrived to appeal to the casual purchaser chime with the resilience required by traders selling in the street. And it is our respect for their spirit and resourcefulness which may account for the long lasting popularity of these poignant images of the self-respecting poor who turned their trades into performances. Even now, it is impossible to hear the cries of market traders and newspaper sellers without succumbing to their spell, as the last reverberations of a great cacophonous symphony echoing across time and through the streets of London.<br /></p> <p>Surely none can resist the romance of the Cries of London and the raffish appeal of the liberty of vagabondage, of those who had no indenture or task master, and who travelled wide throughout the city, witnessing the spectacle of its streets, speaking with a wide variety of customers and seeing life. In the densely populated neighbourhoods, it was the itinerants’ cries that marked the times of day and announced the changing seasons of the year. Before the motorcar, their calls were a constant of street life in London. Before advertising, their songs were the jingles that announced of the latest, freshest produce or appealing gimcrack. Before radio, television and internet, they were the harbingers of news, gossip and novelty ballads. These itinerants had nothing but they had possession of the city.<br /></p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""6285e6596af7c0652da33a7ad6cc48798ea6c3e5""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/6285e6596af7c0652da33a7ad6cc48798ea6c3e5/611_401_2653_1593/1000.jpg"" alt=""Tony Hawkins, a pedlar, was arrested 87 times for selling caramelised peanuts in London’s West End."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Tony Hawkins, a pedlar, was arrested 87 times for selling caramelised peanuts in London’s West End.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: The Gentle Author</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I write these words just a stone’s throw from Brick Lane, where Lionel Begleiter grew up in a first floor flat on the corner of Princelet Street in the 1930s. Although I don’t know on which corner he lived, there is one building with a small window where I can imagine Lionel, as a little boy, leaning out to wonder at the Cries in Brick Lane. For, as “Lionel Bart” in 1960, he wrote Oliver!, the only enduring theatrical dramatisation of Charles Dickens’ work, integrating both music hall and folk song into the stage musical with spectacular success. His setting of Cries of London, as WhoWill Buy this Wonderful Morning? remains the most evocative musical manifestation in the collective consciousness.<br /></p> <p>I leave you with the words of most celebrated Crier in our own century – <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuL1AWo_zgQ"">Muhammad Shahid Nazir</a>, the “One Pound Fish Man” of Queen’s Market in Upton Park – as an example of the acclaim and status that Criers can win in London through their wit, ingenuity and performance skill. Nazir became an internet sensation with 14m views on YouTube, won a recording contract and is now a pop star in Pakistan.<br /></p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Come on ladies, come on ladies</p> <p>One pound fish</p> <p>Have-a, have-a look</p> <p>One pound fish</p> <p>Very, very good, very, very cheap</p> <p>One pound fish</p> <p>Six for five pound</p> <p>One pound each</p> </blockquote> <p>The Cries of London have taught me the essential truth of London street traders down through the centuries, and it is one that still holds today they do not need your sympathy, they only want your respect – and your money.<br /></p> <p><em>The Gentle Author writes daily about the culture of the East End of London at <a href=""http://www.spitalfieldslife.com/"">www.spitalfieldslife.com</a>.

Only in comparison to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/skyfall"">Skyfall</a>, which grossed £10.45m in its third frame, does the Spectre number suffer. After 21 days, Spectre has grossed a hefty £77.6m. Skyfall had reached a very similar £77.3m at the same stage of its run.<br /></p> <p>Skyfall went on to achieve a remarkable £102.9m, and you might say that Spectre looks on course to reach a similar number. One fly in the ointment is that Spectre’s grosses are more front-loaded, with successive weekly declines of 34% and 40%. The equivalent drops for Skyfall were 20% and 35%. In other words, Spectre is, so far, tailing off quicker.</p> <p>Spectre is already the fourth-biggest hit of all time in the UK, behind only Skyfall, Avatar (£94.0m) and Titanic (£80.1m, including the 3D re-release). Next come Toy Story 3 (£74.0m) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (£73.1m).</p> <p>Spectre faces a significant challenge from this Thursday, with the arrival of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/04/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-review-jennifer-lawrence"">The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2</a>.

Twenty years on, the violence is intensifying rather than fading away.</p> <p>What can be done about the new threat posed by Islamic State? The answer is, of course, almost as complicated as the phenomenon of contemporary Islamic militancy itself. There is no magic bullet. Instead, there are dozens of different measures that could each potentially have a minor impact, and collectively a major one. Many, such as diplomacy, the resolution of conflicts across the region, and humanitarian aid to Syrians inside and outside the country, have been discussed at great length in recent days. So, too, have the advantages and disadvantages of various types of military action. And though it is right and proper that the details of David Cameron’s plan to launch British airpower against Isis in Syria are obsessively picked over, other ideas have received less, or indeed no, attention in the debate. Here are eight of them.</p> <h2>1 Kill the caliph</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""77f95a59b3403a32bfae9dc8ea651bf5ecc5dfc1""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/77f95a59b3403a32bfae9dc8ea651bf5ecc5dfc1/0_30_1668_1000/1000.jpg"" alt=""Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a video posted in July last year."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a video posted in July last year.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi <em>(above)</em>, who declared himself “caliph” in Mosul after its capture by Isis last June, is a priority target for western and other regional forces. He has been reported as injured several times, and may well have been badly hurt in one or other of the strikes against him. A bombing campaign does not necessarily help this effort. It has been drones – and the occasional special forces raid – that gutted the high command of al-Qaida, rather than massive use of airpower.</p> <p>Some argue that Baghdadi could be replaced. This is true, in a sense, and though the workings of Isis leadership is extremely opaque, it is just about possible that another candidate could be found who could end up as caliph in the same way his predecessor did. But the death of Baghdadi would cause immense damage to the organisation anyway. It would remove a key focus of loyalty. It could well lead to a succession battle and the fragmentation of the group.</p> <p>At the very least, it would seriously slow their momentum. Of course, followers might see such trials simply as further evidence that the Isis project is a divinely inspired one. But potential recruits might think twice about the more ambitious claims of the group to effective infallibility.</p> <p>One problem, of course, is that assassinations have unpredictable consequences. You never know what is going to fill the vacuum a corpse can create. Osama bin Laden’s death was once widely hailed as a nail in the coffin of al-Qaida, and thus the threat from Islamic militancy to the west. Not any longer.</p> <h2>2 Cut down territory, rather than cutting off cash</h2> <p>Much of the current focus – of policymakers and bombing runs over Syria – is on impeding the ability of Isis to earn money through the sale of oil. Though this generates welcome cash for the organisation – up to a million dollars at day at an earlier stage of the conflict, by some estimates – it is far from their main source of revenue. Nor is the trafficking of antiquities or the ransom of hostages, though both can generate substantial sums. Donations from wealthy Gulf supporters died away long ago, western officials say.<br /></p> <p>The biggest earner for Isis, as for most countries outside the Gulf, is tax. This is tax of the “I’ll make you an offer you cannot refuse” variety, but it is tax nonetheless. Imposed on businesses and smuggling, it raises vast sums. Bombing this is much harder – indeed, well-nigh impossible. This needs to be recognised, and expectations in this area reduced, if an effective broader strategy is to evolve.</p> <p>What is clear is that the new caliphate depends on continued expansion for its existence. Expansion needs money, but also brings money. However, a virtuous cycle, from the point of view of Isis, could easily become a vicious one. Advance could rapidly become retreat, then, quite quickly perhaps, rout.</p> <h2>3 Counter the propaganda<br /></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b670b18e2493adb8b377b90f7fc79efd14e21962""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b670b18e2493adb8b377b90f7fc79efd14e21962/0_0_1875_1125/1000.jpg"" alt=""Isis fighters marching in Raqqa, Syria"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Isis fighters marching in Raqqa, Syria.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isis propaganda is going to keep coming and there is no way we can shut it out. The clips are slick – and made to be watched on a phone by a group of friends on a street corner, or in a cafe, or in a teenager’s bedroom. They are three or four minutes long, full of explicit action, require no thought whatsoever, are sophisticated in their production values and crude in every other way. The differences with other clips cluttering the average western adolescent male’s phone memory – music videos, porn, greatest goals – is clear. But so too are the similarities.</p> <p>What is less well understood is why their message should appeal. This is often missed by those talking about “counter-propaganda”. Saying that you are likely to get killed in Syria rather than live an Islamic ideal, as recent social media messaging from the US and others have pointed out, may be objectively true, but is about as likely to resonate with a 17-year-old as a health warning on a packet of cigarettes. The Isis propaganda’s millenarian message may not appeal to many westerners – but their promise of adventure, comradeship and status does. Why? In part because of the lives these teenagers lead. But also because of the clever appeal to half-understood ideas about the Muslim faith and also, crucially, about Muslim history.</p> <p>If one British militant bought himself Islam for Dummies before heading off to Syria, many others have preferred mythologised biographies of great generals of Islam from earlier ages. This is key. There has been a belated recognition of the importance of religious knowledge as armour against radicalisation, but other areas have been ignored.</p> <p>The idea of recreating a caliphate – the fundamental project of Isis – is that it will restore to Muslims the power and glory and wealth lost over centuries of supposed conflict with the west. Yet relations between “Christianity” and the Muslim world were, as they still are, enormously complex. If there has been violence and war, there has been rich cultural and commercial interchange. There have been alliances as well as enmity. However, little of this context is taught in schools anywhere in Europe. As the mother of one 19-year-old Belgian killed earlier this year said last week: “It’s easy to write on a blank page.”</p> <h2>4 More cash and people for the spooks, but not necessarily more powers</h2> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/30/70000-syrian-fighters-david-cameron-islamic-state-airstrikes"">Who are these 70,000 Syrian fighters David Cameron is relying on?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The failings of the European counter-terrorism establishment have been rudely exposed in recent weeks. Greater powers of surveillance are not necessarily the answer. The primary problem that led to the Paris attacks was not an inability to identify who might be a threat – all the key members of the Paris plot were known to security services – but a failure to keep tabs on potential attackers as they moved about Europe, as well as to and from Syria. European internal borders may have come down, but the walls between insular security services never did. This has to change.</p> <p>Security services also need more resources. The key Belgian counter-terrorism service has a staff of 600, it was revealed last week. Keeping 24-hour surveillance on a single individual takes 30 to 40 people. The result has been an intense focus on a very small number of people and savage prioritisation, often largely arbitrary, to decide who was under the lens. Services across Europe will now get more people and more kit, as well as more powers. But recruitment takes time. The French intelligence services have still yet to fill new posts that were funded after the Paris attacks in January.</p> <p>A key factor has also been a failure to stop people travelling to Syria when they are clearly a threat. One mother in Brussels recounted how, although she had alerted the local police “counter-radicalisation” cell in Molenbeek, her 18-year-old still left the country. As an adult, he could not be stopped from leaving Belgium.</p> <p>Radicalisation is a process, not an event. Massive investment in understanding what is happening to European teenagers has had little impact in the public arena, where many still think the problem is extremist clerics brainwashing people on the internet, but it is paying off elsewhere. <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/what-makes-people-join-isis-expert-says-foreign-fighters-are-almost-never-recruited-at-mosque-a6748251.html"">Oxford University research released last week</a> has shown that radicalisation by anonymous recruiters and strangers is extremely rare, with the overwhelming majority of cases involving friends or family. New America, a nonpartisan thinktank in the US, found that more than a quarter of western fighters in Syria have a familial connection to extremists. Another recent study, at Pennsylvania State University, which examined the interactions of 120 supposed “lone wolf” terrorists from all ideological and faith backgrounds, found that in an astonishing 64% of cases, family and friends were aware of the individual’s intentions because the offender verbally told them.</p> <p>This has meant better attempts to “deradicalise”, or prevent people turning to extremism. There has been one successful Danish experiment using techniques learned from gang exit strategies. It has been controversial, but often effective. This is not surprising. One 18-year-old in Molenbeek last week described Isis as “the biggest, most violent street gang in the world”.</p> <h2>5 Strengthen local governments</h2> <p>This is simple in concept, if rarely in execution. It has two parts: narrow and broad. The narrow strategy focuses on building the counter-terrorist, or indeed counter-insurgency, capabilities of countries engaged in fighting Islamic extremists on their territory – or strengthening local coalitions of de facto allies in what is, after all, a global campaign.<br /></p> <p>This indirect strategy has serious limitations – the government in Syria has killed at least 200,000 of its own people, far more than Isis has done – and has failed spectacularly on previous occasions. It also brings harsh choices about the kind of government that is going to receive aid. If the Assad regime is beyond the pale, many others are predatory, repressive, undemocratic or simply incompetent. From Bangladesh to Nigeria, it is hard not to feel underwhelmed by the quality of the leaders and, particularly, counter-terrorist actors who would become recipients of aid.</p> <p>The broader strategy recognises that governance is key. Spread a map covering the swath of land from western Africa to the Pacific Rim and it is fairly clear that the places where Islamic militancy thrives are places where government is weak and/or predatory, repressive etc, or simply non-existent. Libya, Nigeria, Somalia, Afghanistan, the Sinai, Syria and Iraq, Yemen, parts of Pakistan, bits of Bangladesh. If a short-term strategy focuses on fighting now, then anything long-term has to address this fundamental truth.</p> <h2>6 Better integration of immigrant communities</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""eaee42acdcff48b7b1256a1e6229ecef1ba361d0""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/eaee42acdcff48b7b1256a1e6229ecef1ba361d0/0_94_3528_2117/1000.jpg"" alt=""Security checks at a vigil for the Paris attacks in Molenbeek, Belgium"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Security checks at a vigil for the Paris attacks in Molenbeek, Belgium.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a no-brainer. MI5 talks of a “cognitive opening” that makes an individual vulnerable to a new narrative. Very often, for a young Briton, German or Italian of immigrant background, that is an incident of explicit, or even suspected, discrimination. The job that goes to the candidate with the more easily spelled name. The humiliating <em>contrôle</em>, or stop and search, by the police. The invasion of Iraq, which played into the historical myth of a permanent western conspiracy to divide, humiliate and dominate the Islamic world. The general sense, as expressed by one teenager in Molenbeek to his Moroccan-born parents before his departure to Syria, of “being seen as from over there when I am here and from over here when I am over there”.</p> <p>The problem is how you do it. Supple British pragmatism (or weak-kneed fudge)? Rigorous French republican model? Neither? Both? A mix? All anyone knows right now is that since Europe invited large numbers of immigrant workers into the continent to help rebuild its shattered cities, infrastructure and economies in the 1950s and 1960s, a clear answer has not been found.</p> <p>Once it was believed that the problems were always found among “second-generation” immigrants on the basis that the first tried to forget their roots and the third had acquired new ones. This now looks optimistic.</p> <h2>7 Boost employment – but not because there is any link between poverty and violence</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""048cf23426ad56f77364779ec8e94aa6fcb52db7""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/048cf23426ad56f77364779ec8e94aa6fcb52db7/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg"" alt=""The Brussels bar run by the Abdesalam brothers."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The Brussels bar run by the Abdesalam brothers.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Eric Vidal/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Paris attacks seem to have been planned and run from Brussels by a core of men who lived and grew up within a few hundred yards of each other, in solid brick houses on two narrow streets in the heart of the neighbourhood of Molenbeek. Although this is one of the poorer parts of the Belgian capital, there are much worse places in Belgium, and France, and the UK for that matter. The French <em>cités</em> have produced many violent extremists in the past – men such as Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four and wounded seven in Paris in January in a series of attacks culminating in a hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket.</p> <p>But neither Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the operational commander of the Paris attacks, nor the two Abdelsalam brothers, who played key roles, were poor. The Abdelsalams ran a bar that was closed down for drug trafficking. Abaaoud’s father bought him a shop to run. “They weren’t poor. They had cash. They ate in cafes or pizza bars all the time, not at home,” says a researcher who lives in the neighbourhood and counsels returning Belgian veterans of the fighting in Syria.</p> <p>Many other Islamic militants from the west have been poor, of course, but many have been wealthy. Most of the al-Qaida high command were also highly educated and one – Bin Laden – extremely rich. More recently, there have been private schoolboys and dropouts, petty criminals and highly qualified doctors. The predominant social and economic origins of militants has evolved over the decades, and varies from country to country in Europe, but most security services agree that there is no one profile.</p> <p>However, there are some clues as to what might help prevent people in these areas being radicalised. Youth unemployment levels are very high in Molenbeek, possibly about 40%, and a key element noted by one educator there last week was that very few of those who had left for Syria from the neighbourhood, and certainly none of those who returned to cause violence, had financial responsibilities to others. Things might have been different had they felt unable to run from their obligations, whether simply out of a grudging sense of duty or, perhaps, because the act of providing for others through their own labour gave them a role and a stature that protected them against radicalisation.</p> <h2>8 Plan for more attacks – and be able to withstand them</h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""81eb290a182a93e5c688d57dc673b1efbc859a83""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/81eb290a182a93e5c688d57dc673b1efbc859a83/0_207_3619_2170/1000.jpg"" alt=""A police operation in Molenbeek"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A police operation in Molenbeek.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The concept of “resilience” has begun to edge its way into the counter-terrorist debate to describe measures taken to lessen the potential impact of an attack on a society, nation and community. Much of this has been technical and involved training, better tactics and considerable amounts of cash spent on equipment.</p> <p>But resilience, as some of the more perceptive policymakers realised, meant something deeper: the ability of those who are subject to attack to collectively resist the power of the violence to cause irrational fear. That is, after all, what terrorism sets out to do: prompt anxiety that is disproportionate to the actual risk run by an individual in their daily lives in order to change their behaviour. As that anxiety contaminates an entire society, it creates new circumstances that make the terrorists’ goals easier to reach.</p> <p>So a very important part of beating Isis is accepting that further terrorist operations are inevitable, and so are the deaths of more innocent people, and more horrific scenes in our newspapers and on our various screens. The images of bomb-carrying jets taking off from aircraft carriers on their way to destroy Isis targets in Raqqa or Deir Ezzor may temporarily obscure this dispiriting prospect. However, judging by previous cycles of terrorist violence that have tended to last for 10 to 20 years with a peak about a third of the way through, it will remain for several years to come the background against which planes, civilian or military, will fly – and we will all live.</p>"

Fewer than 10% of its initial strikes were against Isis targets, the majority have been against anti-Assad groups, some backed by the US and Turkey. </p> <h2><strong>What is the current state of Isis in Syria?</strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""22f323226d3af9bff42897e06856ca912ee2f280""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/22f323226d3af9bff42897e06856ca912ee2f280/0_66_3300_1980/1000.jpg"" alt=""A member of Isis carries the flag in Raqqa."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A member of Isis carries the flag in Raqqa.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Isis controls large swaths of north-east Syria including its stronghold of Raqqa and a number of lucrative gas and oil fields in the east.

What he didn’t emphasise is that these fighters are split into at least 100 to 120 different groups, with various aims, and differing in size from thousands to just 100 to 200 members.

Two groups currently dominant are Jaish al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham, which have a <a href=""http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/yes-there-are-70000-moderate-opposition-fighters-in-syria-heres-what-we-know-about-them"">combined strength of 27,500 fighters</a>, according to analyst Charles Lister from the Brookings Doha centre. “Both of these groups and perhaps a small number of others are definitely not natural western allies, no doubt about it. But they vehemently oppose [Isis] being in Syria and have fought it successfully in the past – with far better results than our currently favoured allies, the Kurds,” he points out. </p> <p>One of the other most powerful forces is the al-Qaida linked group, Jabhat al-Nusra, which has also been banned by the US. Both Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have been heavily involved in ousting Isis fighters from Syria’s Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside in the north.</p> <h2><strong>How strong is the Free Syrian Army? </strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""2d5c2b2a98691be5d7308aa82669210b7c3d39ce""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/2d5c2b2a98691be5d7308aa82669210b7c3d39ce/0_0_3500_2099/1000.jpg"" alt=""Free Syrian Army."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Free Syrian Army.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The alliances of “moderate” opposition fighters in Syria is constantly shifting, but many still fight under the broad banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). They control much of the territory in and around the western Syrian cities of Hama and Homs. They include groups such as Tajamu Ala’Azza and Liwa Suqor al-Jebel which have received CIA training and weapons. Groups allied with the FSA also control areas around Syria’s southern border with Jordan. But after years of disunity and faltering advances the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/whos-who-syrian-conflict-russian-airstrikes"">influence of the FSA is on the wane</a>, according to the Guardian’s Syria specialist, Martin Chulov. </p> <h2><strong>Who is fighting whom? </strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/iraq-andsyriaforces/giv-32650xDYvL4IqXqUd/"" data-alt=""Competing forces in Syria’s civil war.""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/iraq-andsyriaforces/giv-32650xDYvL4IqXqUd/"">Competing forces in Syria’s civil war.</a> </figure>  <p>There are a series of global, regional and religious conflicts being played out in Syria that make the conflict so potentially explosive and complicated. These are the main battles: <br /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Assad v the opposition</strong></li> <li><strong>Sunni v Shia: </strong>President Assad and many of those in his inner circle are Alawites – a minority sect in Syria that is a branch of Shia Islam. Shia forces involved in the Syrian civil war on Assad’s side include Iran’s elite Quds force under Qassem Suleimani; the Lebanese group Hezbollah, and the Shia militias of Iraq.<br /></li> <li><strong>Kurdish battle for independence</strong>: Kurds represent about 10% of Syria’s population and live mostly along its border with Turkey and northern Iraq. They have established control of a large part of this area since the withdrawal of Syrian government forces in 2012. The US has used airstrikes to help Kurds hold on to their gains against the advance of Isis. This has alarmed Turkey, which has its own Kurdish population. In the infamous battle for Kobane, Kurdish fighters resisted Isis with help of US airstrikes, while Ankara stood by and refused to allow Kurdish fighters to cross into Syria. Turkey has bombed Kurdish guerrillas in Syria, who it says were aiding fighters on its territory.</li> </ul> <h2><strong>What is the UK’s position?</strong></h2> <p>Whether the UK should get involved in this conflict is the subject of a debate that has exposed serious divisions in the Labour party, but also unease among some government backbenchers. The government’s case is built on the argument that such action would disrupt the ability of Isis to organise attacks in Europe, while containing the extremist group by denying it territory and access to finance, primarily through oil exports. </p> <h2><strong>Will bombing disrupt Isis’s ability to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe?</strong></h2> <p>The investigation into the Paris attacks showed that at least half the perpetrators had undergone some kind of centrally organised training with Isis.<br /></p> <p>The experience of the fight against al-Qaida suggests that precise targeting of training camps and leaders reduced its capacity to strike western capitals. Documents recovered by US navy seals at Osama bin Laden’s compound showed that drone strikes had made it near impossible for al-Qaida to host and train foreign fighters in the main area under its control, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) in western Pakistan.</p> <p>However, there are also signs that Isis has learned from al-Qaida’s mistakes, and now avoids structured training camps, preferring to live and organise in residential buildings among civilians.<br /></p> <p>“In Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Mosul, Isis is living almost totally among civilians, so you can’t hit them,” said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He pointed out that thousands of foreign jihadi had managed to travel to and from <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria"">Syria</a> for the past few years through Turkey and questioned the wisdom of now trying to stop militants with bombs when they could have been stopped with tighter border controls.</p> <p>The Paris conspirators, including the presumed ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were able to travel between Belgium, France and Syria while the US-led airstrikes targeting Isis command and control were in full swing.</p> <h2><strong>Can bombing contain Isis?</strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""5ebae0f5bdd9e09a125eee29ef5ab69e88941e88""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/5ebae0f5bdd9e09a125eee29ef5ab69e88941e88/0_0_3300_1981/1000.jpg"" alt=""Residents inspect a damaged site from what activists said were airstrikes carried out by the Russian air force in Nawa city, Deraa."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Residents inspect a damaged site from what activists said were airstrikes carried out by the Russian air force in Nawa city, Deraa.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alaa Al-Faqir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>US-led airstrikes helped stop Isis capturing key strategic points such as Kobane on the Turkish border, and the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil. In neighbouring Iraq, they were instrumental in preventing the fall of Baghdad when Isis’s power was at its zenith. UK air support also played a role in the liberation of the Iraqi town of Sinjar by Kurdish peshmerga forces.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism experts say that such defeats damage Isis’s international appeal to foreign jihadis, which depends on the image of a constantly expanding “caliphate”.</p> <p>However, further gains against Isis will require something that has so far eluded the western coalition, a working alliance with other Sunni rebel groups in Syria. </p> <p>Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Chatham House thinktank and co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said that persuading other Sunni armed groups to fight Isis as well as the Assad regime may ultimately be the key to success, but that requires a great deal of local knowledge and political commitment.</p> <p>“The answer is not dropping more bombs,” Hassan said. “The answer is to find a way to support these groups on the ground. It’s not about money or even weapons. It is about helping them with tactics and an overall strategy that has been missing.”</p> <p>He argued that the expensive US efforts to build an anti-Isis rebel movement failed because it worked with the wrong people and lacked long-term political commitment. The success of any British military contribution, Hassan added, will lie in the UK’s ability to “break out of the constraints” of Washington’s current strategy.</p> <p>The recent emphasis on striking tankers carrying Isis oil exports is likely to dent the group’s vast financial resources but may not affect its immediate fighting capacity. Hassan said Isis scored its most significant victories before it captured the oil fields.</p> <h2><strong>Could bombing Isis backfire?</strong></h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""b54dde83f81630e9faea646bf7f5ed8986fa4460""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/b54dde83f81630e9faea646bf7f5ed8986fa4460/0_0_1955_1173/1000.jpg"" alt=""Footage from the Russian Defence Ministry of an explosion after airstrikes carried out by Russian air force on Idlib."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Footage from the Russian defence ministry of an explosion after airstrikes carried out by Russian air force on Idlib.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Airstrikes on Raqqa last week are reported to have killed at least 12 people, including five children, when bombs fell near a school. It was not clear whether the bombs were dropped by Russian, American or French planes.</p> <p>“The number of civilian casualties from Russian bombardment is far higher than the number caused by American and French airstrikes,” said Wael Aleji, spokesman for the Syrian Network for Human Rights. “This can be attributed to technology. The Russians use more ‘dumb’ bombs and have less advanced guidance systems.”<br /></p> <p>In his memorandum to the Commons, Cameron pointed to the enhanced precision of the UK’s Brimstone missile as one of the contributions Britain can make to the air campaign. But avoiding civilian casualties will also depend on good intelligence. </p> <p>One of the worst civilian tolls attributed by human rights activists to a US strike was on 1 May <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/02/death-toll-syria-climbs-us-led-air-strike"">near Aleppo</a>, where more than 60 civilians were said to have been killed, perhaps more than half of them children. Abdurrahman said: “We think they got the wrong information. They thought it was Isis, but it wasn’t.”</p> <p>As it becomes harder to find genuine Isis targets, as the terrorist group gets better at melting in with the surrounding population, the civilian toll is likely to rise. And Syrians on the receiving end are unlikely to make the distinction between British warplanes and Russian bombers sent by Assad’s chief ally.</p> <p>“This is likely to generate support for Isis, or at least create indifference among local people,” Hassan said. “These are the risks of unintended consequences.”</p> <h2>Where does the public stand on bombing Syria?</h2> <p>Antiwar demonstrators gathered outside Downing Street and other locations across the UK on Saturday, but a YouGov poll for the Times found that the majority of voters (59%) back airstrikes in Syria. There was clear backing even among Labour voters with 52% saying they would approve of airstrikes compared with 26% against. But Labour members, especially those who voted for Corbyn in the leadership contest, were overwhelming opposed to the move. Meanwhile Labour said a random sample of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/30/majority-labour-members-oppose-syria-isis-airstrikes-poll-says"">full individual Labour party members showed 75% were against UK bombing in Syria</a>, 13% were in favour and 11% were undecided.</p>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/dylsharpe/statuses/671236829291655168"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Diane Abbott keeps saying the public are opposed to air strikes on Syria.

A victory for George Galloway or a victory for Sadiq Khan?”</p> <p>Historical perspective matters here, as do recent political events. Galloway is, famously, a former Labour MP who was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/23/labour.georgegalloway"">expelled from the party</a> in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute in the way he had conducted his opposition to British participation in the Iraq war. The insubordinate Dundonian dubbed the proceedings that sealed his fate “a show trial” and retaliated by <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2005blog/2005/may/06/gallowaywinsi"">winning</a> the London East End parliamentary seat of Bethnal Green and Bow in the 2005 general election for the newly-formed Respect Party after a bitter battle with Labour’s Oona King.</p> <p>Since then, Galloway has been a roaming plague of his former comrades, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/d56.stm"">unsuccessfully contesting</a> a different Labour-held East End seat in 2010 but handsomely <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17549388"">winning a by-election</a> in Bradford West two years later at his former party’s expense. Defending that prize at this year’s general election, Galloway accused his Labour opponent Naz Shah of, among other things, lying about the age she’d been when pressured into marrying a cousin in Pakistan. He <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/george-galloway-loses-bradford-west-seat-labour-naz-shah-respect"">lost to her</a>. But he soon <a href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/george-galloway-announces-plan-to-run-for-london-mayor-10281834.html"">confirmed his intention</a> to contest next May’s London mayoral race. <br /></p> <p>That was before anyone dreamed that Jeremy Corbyn would, on 12 September, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-wins-labour-party-leadership-election"">succeed Ed Miliband as Labour leader</a> and, in so doing, create a whole new setting in which the mayoral battle will unfold. When Galloway was a Labour MP, he and Corbyn were fellow members of the parliamentary left’s awkward squad: war-opposers, all-purpose leadership-defiers, anti-Blairites incarnate. By the end of July, when a Corbyn win had become a stunningly large possibility, Galloway <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/07/30/george-galloway-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party_n_7906754.html"">declared to LBC’s Iain Dale</a> his enthusiasm for re-joining the Labour fold. And since Corbyn’s amazing ascent to the Labour throne, Galloway’s public conduct of his mayoral business has been, to put it mildly, intriguing. <br /></p> <p>There have been two conspicuous strands. One has been his expressions of pleasure in Corbyn’s triumph and accompanying disclosures about his closeness to Corbyn and members of his team. These claims of intimacy scaled a new peak over the weekend when the Sunday Times <a href=""http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1632262.ece"">reported</a> him <a href=""http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/seumas-milne-finds-time-for-george-galloway/"">describing</a> Seumas Milne, my fellow Guardian writer who’s taken leave to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/20/guardian-journalist-seumas-milne-labour-head-communications"">become Corbyn’s executive director of strategy and communications</a>, as his “closest friend” with whom he has “spoken almost daily for 30 years.”</p> <p>The second conspicuous strand of Galloway interviews has comprised cutting personal attacks on Khan, who is, of course, Labour’s mayoral candidate. He’s called him a “very boring man”, a “flip-flop merchant”, a “product of the Blairite machine”, an accomplice in Blair/Brown “crimes and blunders” and an “unprincipled speak-your-weight machine” who “went into what can only be described as a swoon over kissing the queen’s hand.” <br /></p> <p>Galloway also appears to consider Khan, a Muslim, an inadequate practitioner of his faith, <a href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/george-galloway-i-ve-always-fancied-being-mayor-and-next-year-i-finally-could-be-a3106411.html"">telling the Evening Standard</a> that the Labour man erred by holding the Koran “in his left hand” when he met the monarch and that this “wasn’t missed by people who care about these things”. He’s taken issue with Khan’s criticisms of Corbyn’s economic policies, saying, “I know that it hasn’t been popular in Corbyn’s circle,” and has named the MP for Tooting as his prime target: “It’s me versus Sadiq Khan for the centre-left vote.” <br /></p> <p>What’s he up to? Notwithstanding recent <a href=""http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2015/11/labour-supporters-are-still-backing-jeremy-corbyn-in-droves/"">good approval ratings</a> for Corbyn among Labour members, it is widely held that the party leader’s position will be weakened if Khan fails to defeat Conservative Zac Goldsmith, the only other mayoral candidate who looks to have a serious chance of winning the race for City Hall. Yet here is Galloway, a professed Corbyn admirer, doing all in his power to damage Khan’s chances. Does he believe that his conduct is actually helping Corbyn or is something rather different going on?</p> <p>Such was the backdrop to my question, which I put to Galloway during a public meeting held on Tuesday evening at the <a href=""http://www.timeout.com/london/music/venues/orford-house-social-club-stow-film-lounge"">Orford House Social Club</a> in Walthamstow, E17. His answer began with a metaphor he often favours. “Sadiq Khan supports Jeremy Corbyn like the rope supports the hanging man,” he said, winning a ripple of laughter among the 100-plus people present. <br /></p> <p>It was an interesting crowd: very diverse ethnically and covering a pretty wide age range. Behind me sat the always-friendly <a href=""http://moderngov.towerhamlets.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=321"">Oliur Rahman</a>, leader of the Independent group on Tower Hamlets council and <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32441397"">erstwhile deputy</a> of that borough’s fallen former mayor <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/jun/10/tower-hamlets-the-rise-and-fall-lutfur-rahman"">Lutfur Rahman</a> (no relation). <br /></p> <p>Galloway proceeded to batter Khan some more, pointing out that he had nominated Corbyn for the Labour leadership race yet hadn’t voted for him, and then, after Corbyn had won, “gave a series of interviews in the <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3241649/Labour-s-Mayor-savages-Corbyn-Party-star-Khan-damns-leader-anti-Semitism.html"">Mail on Sunday</a>, that well known friend of Labour, and the <a href=""http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/145335/interview-sadiq-khan-believe-me-i-wont-be-another-ken-livingstone"">Jewish Chronicle</a>, ditto, in which he denounced Jeremy Corbyn in the most withering terms.” <br /></p> <p>The Respect man said that Khan had accused Corbyn of “encouraging terrorism in London by his relationship to the Palestinian resistance and by his past relations with the Irish Republican Movement.” He continued: “I have no doubt whatsover that Sadiq Khan is part of the cabal which is seeking to bring Jeremy Corbyn down.” Then he said: “So, I don’t know the answer, Dave, to your question, because I’ve never asked him...”</p> <p>I interrupted the orator’s flow: “But what is your opinion? Which result would please Jeremy most?”</p> <p>“This is what I’m going say,” continued Galloway. “It’s not a direct answer,” he admitted, with a certain impish complicity, “but it’s as good as you’re going to get. If you’re looking for a Corbyn in this election, it’s me. It’s not Sadiq Khan. I support all of Jeremy Corbyn’s policies. I might put them a little differently. If you don’t mind me saying so, I might put them a little better. But I support them. Sadiq Khan opposes them and makes no bones about doing so. So if I was Jeremy, I’d want me to win.” <br /></p> <p>This time the applause was more a wave than a ripple and it spoke of the opportunity I sense Galloway believes he has detected in this part of London, and no doubt in others too. <br /></p> <p>To his left on the platform sat Respect’s London Assembly candidate for the area Mukhtar Ghaffar and to his left Abdul Majid, vice president of the <a href=""http://www.wfia.org.uk/about/4577933571"">Waltham Forest Islamic Association</a>. Candidate Ghaffar had been introduced as having felt the call to return to E17 after runnning a successful business in Dubai and setting up a charity for children in South Africa. He’d made a speech rich in talk of community solidarity, describing “the beauty of being an East Ender”, outlining his family’s 50-year association with Waltham Forest and concluding with an excerpt from a speech Princess Diana had given in 1993. “Deep within us all is a need to care, and be cared for,” it began. This was somewhat unexpected. In part because of that and in part due to a copy of Galloway’s biography of Fidel Castro being propped on the desk in front on him, it was also rather lovely in a particular way.<br /></p> <p>Ghaffar had reminisced about the Walthamstow market of his childhood and spoken about gentrification: “It’s not a bad thing, but it becomes a bad thing when it affects the people who have been living here for several years.” He’d spoken about housing, telling stories of a single mother he’d met having to move from place to place, and of locally-born young professionals still living with their parents because they can’t afford to move in to places of their own nearby. <br /></p> <p>Then he’d moved on to the Walthamstow “mini-Holland” cycling scheme, a substantial programme of street infrastructure changes introduced by Labour-run Waltham Forest Council using £30m awarded by Boris Johnson with the aim of promoting pedal power. It has not met with universal acclaim. While cycling campaigners have praised it, residents and small businesses inconvenienced by road closures and loss of parking space have <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/07/waltham-forest-mini-holland-row-politics-protests-and-house-prices"">protested outside the Town Hall</a>. Ghaffar described meeting a large group of mini-Holland objectors on Saturday. He asked, rhetorically, where the elected local politicians had been. “If they’re not representing your interests, then whose interests are they truly representing?” He termed Galloway “a man of honour.”<br /></p> <p>Abdul Majid had spoken next, listing a top three areas of local concern: one, Islamophobia, drawing attention to a Facebook comment made by a Labour councillor back in January that <a href=""http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/11760856.Labour_councillor_suspended_over_Prophet_Facebook_row/?ref=rl"">led to his suspension</a> but eventual <a href=""http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/13593850.Councillor__cleared_of_any_wrongdoing__after_Facebook_Prophet_row/"">clearing</a>; two, “everyone’s favourite” the mini-Holland scheme whose parking regulations, Majid said, are “restricting our right to worship and affecting our local businesses across the board”; three, affordable housing especially for young people. Majid praised Galloway for his alternative vision and described him as “a great spokesperson on the Palestinian issue.” <br /></p> <p> I think you’re getting the lie of the land. This is firmly Labour territory: <a href=""http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/stella-creasy/4088"">Stella Creasy</a> is the well-established local MP and the council has a <a href=""http://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=26"">hefty Labour majority</a>. But it is territory that’s changing fast in ways not everyone is comfortable with. Like other Outer London boroughs, Waltham Forest has experienced gradual, long-term demographic change, becoming more <a href=""https://www.walthamforest.gov.uk/Pages/Services/statistics-economic-information-and-analysis.aspx"">ethnically and culturally varied</a>. It is also having to contend with higher rates of poverty, as <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/03/why-has-london-poverty-become-more-spread-out"">so much of Outer London is</a>. <br /></p> <p>Yet more prosperous people are also entering the mix, as the capital’s rocketing house prices have caused first-time buyers and young renters from elsewhere to look for places to live that lie further from the centre than they would have thought of settling in in the past (one of my own children for instance). At the south end of the borough, a place where the inner city in the form of east Hackney begins its transition into suburbia, an influx of more affluent people with tastes and values to match is re-altering the area’s social complexion. Rocketing house prices and a blossoming cycling culture - one being actively fostered by the council - are just the most conspicuous indicators. <br /></p> <p>In this lie seeds of local discontent and Galloway can see their potential. The meeting was his fourth visit to Walthamstow in four days, including one to the market and one to the Leabridge mosque. His speech, delivered with his customary brio, visited every sore spot represented in the hall, although it was set against “the backdrop of the gravest possible international situation.” <br /></p> <p>The shooting down of a Russian warplane at the Turkish border, which had, he said, “placed NATO at dagger’s drawn” with Vladimir Putin’s state and destroyed the UN security council’s <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34900384"">post-Paris resolution</a> to seek a ceasefire in Syria. “The action today incinerates any possibility of a united front of which we could even have been members in tackling this infestation of fanatic extremism known as ISIS and Al-Qaeda,” he concluded. <br /></p> <p>Galloway bemoaned police cuts at a time when London requires more security and urged people to not “confuse me with a liberal. I am not and never have been a liberal. The police will find a friend in me. If a terrorist turns up in London to harm people they will be shot down dead, and if I can I’ll pull the trigger myself.” This brought further applause.</p> <p>He revealed that earlier that day he’d put the “finishing touches” to his forthcoming documentary <a href=""http://www.theblairdoc.com/"">The Killings of Tony Blair</a>. “I was recalling as I watched the final product that everything that has happened since 2002 and 2003 and the invasion and occupation of Iraq,” had been predicted by everyone “including our own security services.” And so: “If I’m the mayor, London will declare peace on the world.” Expression of this declaration would mean: “We will not roll out red carpets for the likes of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/12/indian-pm-confronted-by-angry-protesters-in-downing-street"">[Narendra] Modi</a>, the killer prime minister of India” or Egypt’s <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/why-is-david-cameron-welcoming-egypt-autocrat-president-sisi-to-london"">Abdel Fatah al-Sisi</a>. The same would apply, he said, “to Netanyahu, the tyrant from Israel.”</p> <p>When he was protesting against Modi at Downing Street, he went on, “Sadiq Khan was inside.” This is true. Galloway then said that Khan “has hired Modi’s chief public relations man [Manoj Ladwa] as one of the people running his mayoral campaign” This is not true, Khan’s team assures me: “Manoj Ladwa is someone Sadiq knows and who gave a bit of advice during the candidate selection contest on a voluntary basis, but has no connection with the mayoral campaign.”</p> <p>Moving closer to home, Galloway pledged to fight for social housing, especially council housing, and to demand of private developers that 50% of all new homes they build be “affordable.” In this, his stance is, in fact, identical to Khan’s, though Galloway insisted that under him the developers’ “party will be over” whereas Khan, he noted, meaningfully, had <a href=""http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/revealed-labour-mayoral-hopefuls-accepting-tens-of-thousands-in-donations-from-property-tycoons-a2919631.html"">accepted a campaign donation</a> from one.<br /></p> <p>“Transport is the third great part of this triptych of issues,” he intoned, delivering that “tripych” with clipped relish. Not for the first time, he took a swing at taxi firm Uber and said that under a Mayor Galloway every school and college student would travel free on London buses and that all apprentices, police officers, firefighters, ambulance personnel and “other key essential workers” will “travel free on London transport.” <br /></p> <p>Denouncing what he mistakenly called the “little Holland” scheme required careful footwork from him, he quipped, “because my wife is Dutch.” But he likened the council to “a one-party state” that had ignored peoples’ concerns about the scheme’s effects. “Small businesses need footfall and the ability of people to arrive in cars, park for a short time and get what they need. In an area with a dense concentration of places of religious worship - not just mosques but many others - does it make sense to make that mosque inaccessible by car?”</p> <p>There was a fruitful question and answer session at the end, which gave Galloway another chance to lambast his Labour opponent. A young man who described himself as “a very proud British Muslim” criticised Khan for his <a href=""http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6758184/Sadiq-Khan-says-its-time-to-tackle-the-extremists.html"">recent article</a> in “the trashy Sun,” which argued that British Muslims have “a special role to play” in tackling Islamist extremism at home. <br /></p> <p>In it, Khan repeated points he’d made in a speech to the Commons press gallery two days earlier, a move I’d judged both <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/nov/20/sadiq-khans-words-on-islamists-and-britain-were-authentic-and-shrewd"">authentic and shrewd</a>. The young man, though, was incensed that Khan’s words had appeared in the same issue of the Sun whose headline had controversially read: “1 in 5 Brit Muslims’ sympathy for jihadis.” This claim was made on the strength of an opinion poll whose credibility has <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/23/sun-poll-respondents-found-using-list-of-muslim-surnames"">since been challenged</a>, as has the Sun’s <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/24/1in5muslims-sun-front-page-muslims-twitter-mocks"">representation</a> of its findings.</p> <p>The young man thought the whole episode very divisive. Galloway remarked disparagingly on my article - the Guardian received a number of friendly mentions during the evening - and accepted the “salute” of the young man, who’d praised him as a conviction politician. “I have only one set of principles,” Galloway said. “I have only one set of beliefs. With me you know what you’re going to get.” <br /></p> <p>We’ll have a better idea quite soon if what Galloway is offering London is as stupendous as he claims - his new campaign website is to be launched in the next few days. Meanwhile, his two-track attitude to Labour - lauding its national leader and rubbishing its mayoral candidate - shows no sign of abating. And neither is there any outward sign of Labour re-embracing him, despite Corbyn being at the helm. Galloway’s desire to have has expulsion rescinded has, of course, not been met and Corbyn himself told <a href=""http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2015/07/jeremy-corbyn-interview-i-think-we-have-think-terms-disillusioned-who-didn-t"">New Statesman</a> back in July that he had found “appalling” the tactics Galloway had used in losing Bradford West. <br /></p> <p>The Labour leader is not alone in feeling that way. Dawn Butler, Labour MP for Brent Central and chair of the women’s parliamentary Labour party, has criticized Galloway on the same grounds. There would be “an almighty revolt” if he returned to the Labour fold, <a href=""http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2015/11/12/no-way-to-galloway-2/"">she wrote</a>. Significantly, she added: “I have spoken to Jeremy Corbyn and he has told me he is not in favour of letting Galloway back in.” Butler also wrote: “I have had it suggested that those arguing for his readmission want to stop him standing in the London mayoral election and damaging the prospects of our superb candidate Sadiq Khan.”</p> <p>Butler briskly dismissed any serious threat to Khan’s chances, but Galloway clearly still has admirers in London. How numerous they are is hard to say, but he knows who they are and where they live. Every vote he wins next May that would otherwise have gone to Khan can only help Goldsmith in what could be a very close race. One senior London Labour figure reckons Galloway is seeing how much purchase with Corbyn his challenge to Khan might have: “I think he’s using it as a bargaining tool. He’s playing with the party to see what pans out.”</p> <p>Well, you wouldn’t rule it out. To repeat: “If I was Jeremy, I’d want me to win,” Galloway said. I wonder what Jeremy wants. <br /></p>"

The deal should not be seen as an end point, but as a “waypoint”.</p> <p>In terms of a collective global problem, “issues do not get any bigger” than climate change, he said.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Left unchecked, it will magnify existing problems and increase pressure on resources including land, water, energy, food and fish stocks. It has the potential to erode development gains, undermine economic growth and compound human security challenges.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week’s terrorist attacks would, he said, “only strengthen the resolve” of the French government to come out of the talks with an ambitious deal.</p> <p>He speculated that the success of the Paris agreement could boil down to the willingness of richer countries to commit to financing for developing countries. In exchange for this, developing nations could then sign the deal.</p> <p>So here’s what Woolcott had to say about Paris; about multilateral international talks; about the UN; and about climate change.</p> <p>It’s long, but think of it as a briefing for the Paris talks by the person representing the Australian government’s agenda who has been, and will be, in the room. I’ll be “outside the room” for the second week of the talks.</p> <p>I’ve uploaded Woolcott’s entire talk onto <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/readfearn/peter-woolcott-speech#t=0:59"">Soundcloud</a> (apologies for the scratchy audio at times) where you can also hear his thoughts on Australian government efforts to prevent the UN world heritage committee from placing the Great Barrier Reef on its “in-danger list”. Scroll to the bottom to hear it all.</p> <h2>Woolcott on shifting powers</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Twenty years ago the US and Europe could often dictate the terms of the debate. If they wanted to push something through strongly enough, they could do so. Now it’s different and the game has changed. There are now no longer one or two hegemonic powers and power is shifting to coalitions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Woolcott said coalitions such as Brics (China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Russia) “occupy critical positions”. Other emerging powers such as Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan and Nigeria were “similarly focused on occupying a place at the top table and preserving their political and economic freedom of movement.”</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>We are also dealing with a much more fluid ideological landscape. A significant number of these emerging powers want the west’s material progress but they do not want to sacrifice their own cultural identities and political traditions. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The west’s vision of modernity and human rights is under challenge. Nationalism, state sovereignty, state capitalism and religious identity are growing forces and are being used to strike at fundamental concepts such as freedom of expression and responsibility to protect.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Secondly, behind this shift in the power dynamics is the increasing pace of globalisation and the extraordinary wealth transfer from west to east.</p> <p>Third, not only is there a shift in national power, but there is a shift in the very nature of power. As a result of new communications technologies exemplified by social media, power is moving to coalitions and networks that are able to effectively influence state actions, particularly in liberal democratic societies.</p> <p>What characterises them is their ability for mass organisation, speed and multiple and diverse actions, and you see this very much in the environmental space. The strength of these networks whether they be civil society, sub-national entities or business groupings, will only grow and increasingly questions will arise as to how they should exercise this power and to who they are accountable.</p> <p>These factors greatly complicate the decision-making and are putting significant stress on international governance, at a time when we need the system to work effectively.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Woolcott on responding to climate change</h2> <blockquote> <p>The policy response will require coordinated action in an unprecedented way across economic and ideological divides. The stakes are high and the multilateral institutional tools that are at our disposal are somewhat compromised. </p> <p>Part of the problem is history. In the multilateral setting, we tend to rely on the outcomes of old battles where they be previously agreed language, or previously agreed processes or the ways of conducting themselves and they tend to dictate or try and dictate the future.</p> <p>This is Ok if we are content with incremental progress, but we are not and we need to change the very basis in which we address climate change.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that the UNFCCC had “set up a divide between the developed world and the developing world” and that it was still struggling to shake this off. </p> <h2>Woolcott on what Australia wants in Paris</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>What Australia wants in Paris is a strong and effective legal agreement that is applicable to all countries and drives serious reductions in emissions while ensuring economic prosperity.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It has to be an agreement that reflects the real world and the way it has changed and continues to change.</p> <p>We are however stuck with an outmoded convention that divides the world into the developed and developing country camps – annex 1 and non-annex 1 countries. </p> <p>It assigns them very different obligations and responsibilities, all based on GDP levels from 1992. China, Singapore and Korea, for example, are all deemed developing countries for the purpose of climate action. </p> <p>We have little chance of tackling climate change based on these divisions. Let me reinforce this point with a few statistics. </p> <p>In 1992 only three non-annex 1 countries – or to put it simply developing countries – were among the 12 largest emitters. Today this has risen to seven. </p> <p>Now non-annex 1 countries represent two-thirds of total emissions and this will be nearly three quarters of total emissions by 2030.</p> <p>So not only is the engineering obsolete, the decision-making machinery is cumbersome. The 195 parties to the convention must make decisions by consensus. </p> <p>While it is right that responses to global problems endorsed by most countries have a legitimacy that agreements negotiated amongst smaller groups lack, the reality in UNFCCC is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and decisions usually result in lowest common denominator outcomes. </p> <p>So the UNFCCC reflects the microcosm of problems of the wider UN. We are between multilateral worlds. The old world dominated by the west can no longer dictate – nor finance alone – the solution.</p> <p>The new world has not yet arrived and the emerging powers are reluctant to take on responsibilities which might compromise their freedom of manoeuvre and their economic developments.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Woolcott on success in Paris</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Success at Paris is not a given. As I said, change is hard.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>There is a strong sense that the world’s largest two emitters are working collaboratively to an agreement in Paris although they have slightly different visions as to what that agreement will look like.</p> <p>These are all critical differences to what unfolded in Copenhagen. There are others, in particular what is the utilisation of a clever strategy of having states announce their intended nationally determined contributions – that is their post-2020 emissions targets – before Paris. To date 161 countries have announced post-2020 targets, which include all of the G20 countries and covers over 90% of global emissions. This is quite a remarkable statistic.</p> <p>While they vary in ambition and detail, it is an extraordinary number and will go higher before we reach Paris.</p> <p>The deal in Paris will be built around these nationally determined targets. I should be clear here. Paris is about negotiating the agreement text. It is not about negotiating the targets.</p> <p>But in setting targets in this bottom-up way we have recognised the limits of multilateralism in addressing climate change.</p> <p>We have recognised that the top-down multilateralism – the old way of doing it which imposes emissions targets on countries – doesn’t work and that if we are to ensure a global, effective and durable solution then we need to set up a system whereby it might be self-determined, is subject to public and peer pressure, it is subject to review and transparency and cognisant of the science.</p> <p>We have also learned that a successful climate deal needs participation before ambition. It needs all countries on the same footing for taking action before we ramp up that action. It would be pointless to have a deal on paper if the US or China won’t sign up to it.</p> <p>So the agreement in Paris will be framed by what countries can accept given their national circumstances. For example we expect that only the obligation to have a target, not the target itself, will be legally binding – an approach that gets around the US difficulties of treaty verification.</p> <p>So how will Paris work out? It is hard to predict, but my sense is that the real danger is not that there will be no agreement but that it will be a minimalist agreement – that Paris will tie a neat bow around the INDCS and that much of what we want in terms of transparency, accountability, durability and review may be lost.</p> <p>The minister at a negotiating level will be working hard to avoid this and for an ambitious and durable agreement.</p> <p>Within the UNFCC Australia has developed significant multilateral muscle. We are effective operators and play the honest broker well, especially from our role as chair of the umbrella group – the negotiating group that includes the US, Japan, Russia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway.</p> <p>The outcome on how emissions targets are captured in the Paris agreement will be due in no small part to the Australia’s 2009 idea … of creating a schedule for commitments. We including the French are also engaged in seeking to manage expectations in a realistic way.</p> <p>Let me repeat, Paris will not put us on track to keep global warming below two degrees. That should not lead to a Copenhagen moment with headlines the morning after saying we have failed. Paris is a waypoint, not the final destination in our efforts to tackle climate change.</p> <p>What is different about Paris compared to our past efforts is that we are building a wider, silver buckshot approach which better harnesses national, bilateral and non-government efforts and builds into the agreement a dynamic and durable process that puts us all on the same floor and allows us to work within the two-degree goal.</p> <p>The Paris agreement must reflect and build on the real world action that has already moved well passed old political divisions so rampant in the United Nations and establish partnerships for the future. It is a huge test for the system.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Woolcott on beating 2C</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The international community is guided by the science and is seeking to limit the rise in global temperatures to below two degrees Celsius.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Now there is no expectation that Paris will show that we are on track to meet that two-degree goal …  But what we want the agreement to do is to set out an agreement to build global action over time which has all countries similarly engaged and provides us with a pathway to stand the two-degree goal.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Woolcott on what should be in the Paris deal</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Australia has been working for three things in the agreement.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>First, to seek that all countries, especially major economies, commit to mitigation efforts that are nationally determined but also meet minimum-quality criteria for mitigation.</p> <p>Secondly, to ensure accountability and transparency in how states are meeting their commitments. We need this in order to judge how we are tracking collectively against the below-two degree goal, and to see whether our neighbours, trade partners and competitors are doing what they say.</p> <p>This transparency will build confidence which in turn will build greater ambition.</p> <p>And thirdly a durable process that will allow us to build action over time to keep within a two-degree guardrail through a regular periodic process that prompts states to revisit and update their national mitigation efforts through five-year cycles.</p> <p>Developing countries have argued that this agreement must give legal status to adaptation. We understand these concerns and have sought to be constructive in addressing this. The Paris outcome should encourage the mainstreaming of adaptation and promote the sharing of best practice. We need to assist the most vulnerable to manage and adapt to the economic and security implications of climate change and we need to build disaster-response capacities and strengthen economic and governance resilience within countries.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Woolcott on Pacific islands and Australia</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>For the small island states, particularly in the Pacific, climate change is an existential challenge.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Our development program in the Pacific is focused on climate resilience and building in disaster-response capacities. Despite the occasional heightened rhetoric from the South Pacific, at the practical level we work closely with them in pursuit of an ambitious Paris agreement. </p> <p>We also know that Australia needs to prioritise resistance to climate impacts nationally and through international partnerships.</p> <p>We will produce a national climate resilience and adaptation strategy which Minister Hunt will release at Paris. </p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Woolcott on Paris sticking points</strong></h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>There are many contentious issues still to be resolved – things like loss and damage, legal form, transparency and accounting, cycles of compliance, review and long-term goals – but the two biggest issues are finance and differentiation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>These are inextricably linked. Ultimately it may well come down to the ask by the developing world in relation to climate finance in order to secure their participation in a common and legally binding agreement to tackle climate change.</p> </blockquote> <p>Woolcott said there had already been good progress towards a commitment made in Copenhagen to make US$100bn a year available to poorer countries by 2020.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The amounts required in the future are enormous both for adaptation and for a low emissions future. A recent Bloomberg energy report has stated that up until 2040 US$12.2tn will be required for power generation and some 78% of this to the developing world. We are dealing with vast sums of money.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Much of this finance will have to come from the private sector. And will also require an expanding country donor base. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Woolcott on the role of civil society groups and business</h2> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>Civil society has always played a highly constructive role and will continue to do so. They might be styled as observers but they are in fact often participants and not only pressure governments but are often part of developing countries’ negotiating teams.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>What is changing dramatically now is the role of business and industry. The private sector and innovation are going to be critical if we are going to tackle climate change. They have viewed the UNFCCC as irrelevant at best …. </p> <p>One of the things that has changed is that the national determination of targets has created the necessary domestic conversations with stakeholders. </p> <p>Australia has seen commitments from a host of major companies – the ANZ, the National Bank, BHP Billiton and AGL – in Paris there will be a series of themed action days and non-government meetings involving business, industry, NGOs, cities and other sub-state actors. </p> <p>The aim is to create a link between the on-ground action by these organisations with the political leadership that multilateral processes provide, as well as governance. The French have been exceptional in driving this change in approach which recognises the private sectors crucial roles in tackling climate change.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/26/gates-to-invest-2bn-in-breakthrough-renewable-energy-projects"">Bill Gates’ announcement to provide $2bn</a> of his money for research and development to tackle climate change “shows how the ground is changing”.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>This more expansive approach to engendering climate action beyond just states gets around a core criticism of multilateralism – that once institutional solution is imposed, it cauterises the need to think about the problem any more.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The Paris action days will seek to turn this criticism on its head by using an institutional process to think more deeply and widely about how to act on climate change.</p> <p>While it is also changing the relationship between civil society and the corporate sector – and this is a very interesting development – there is an increasing understanding that civil society and corporate Australia do not need to be on opposing sides of the divide and they need to work constructively together. </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>In this context I refer to the statement of principles by the <a href=""http://www.australianclimateroundtable.org.au/"">Australian Climate Roundtable</a> which really is an impressive illustration of this collaboration.</p> <p>These groups have real and growing power in the multilateral system and with power comes both responsibility and accountability. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=""element element-audio"" data-canonical-url=""https://soundcloud.com/readfearn/peter-woolcott-speech""> <iframe width=""460"" height=""460"" src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F233706526&show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>"

Another theory is that even where political and business policies are improving, many employers still organise the working day around the stereotypes of women as caregivers at home and men as breadwinners at work.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/unequal-pay-the-life-cycle-of-a-womans-earning-power"">Unequal pay: the life cycle of a woman's earning power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, which campaigns on gender parity, warned on Wednesday that equality would matter more and more as computers took over the economy.</p> <p>“We need to create a world where women’s contributions and ideals are as valued as those of men,” Schwab said. “Gender parity in our thinking and actions will be critical in helping to ensure that the future is served by humanity and not threatened by it.”</p> <p>The WEF, famous for its annual winter gathering of the world’s richest and most powerful people in the Swiss resort of Davos, is publishing its <a href=""http://wef.ch/gendergap15"">10th annual report on gender parity</a>. The latest figures calculate that the average full-time salary for a working woman is $11,102 a year – little more than half the male average of $20,554. This almost matches men’s average income in 2006, which the WEF estimated at $11,351 (women’s pay then was $6,117). </p> <p>Adjusted for inflation, the picture is worse: in today’s money, men were earning more than $13,000 in 2006 – but because it was the first year of the WEF report they cannot say how much more than a decade behind that would put women’s incomes.</p> <p>The pay figures are part of the WEF’s annual report on all aspects of the gender gap, which also covers education, health and political empowerment. Based on scores for dozens of those indicators, Iceland comes out top, followed by Norway, Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Rwanda. The UK comes 18th, the US is 28th, and Australia is back at 36th.</p>  <figure class=""element element-interactive interactive"" data-interactive=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"" data-canonical-url=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/gender_gap_chart-zip/giv-32650VU3ZIJXUIpxk"" data-alt=""Gender pay disparities around the world""> <a href=""https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/11/gender_gap_chart-zip/giv-32650VU3ZIJXUIpxk"">Gender pay disparities around the world</a> </figure>  <p>As well as the moral, rights-driven pressure to narrow the gaps, pay discrimination between men and women is a loss to employers and the wider economy, according to Willem Adema, senior economist for the OECD, the international economic thinktank.</p> <p>“It’s the same with all sorts of discrimination, whether it’s of a sexual orientation or whatever,” Adema said. “If discrimination means people not pursuing individual aspirations to the full … the economy loses out on a lot of talent.”</p> <p>Global averages inevitably mask huge differences between countries and even regions. Nordic countries dominate the list for all measures, including pay.<br /></p> <p>However, top performers are not all predictable. For comparing average total incomes for men and women, eight countries appear to have reached parity, but those figures will be distorted because the survey does not measure average incomes above $40,000. Of those countries where proper comparisons can be made, Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana and Vietnam come out on top. Algeria, Iran, Jordan, Pakistan and India are the worst performers.<br /></p> <p>The list of countries that have best succeeded in closing the gap between men and women in the economy – which also includes the rate of women working and in leadership roles – is topped by Bolivia, France, Nicaragua and Ecuador. Nordic countries, despite having topped the league 10 years ago, have also continued to go further than most to improve the lot of women who want to work.</p> <p>Pay for women has traditionally been depressed by the fact that so many more women than men work in low-paid public sector and “caring” professions, and do part-time work, which is often in low-pay sectors.</p> <p>However, the WEF report also finds a wide gap between the rates of pay for men and women doing the same work: for every $1 earned by a man, researchers estimate that, on average, a woman will get little more than 60 cents.</p> <p>The country that scores best for paying men and women most equally for similar work is Rwanda, while Zambia is third and Albania fifth. The worst scores are for Angola, Brazil, France, Chile and Argentina.<br /></p> <p>Solutions to the continuing gender gap in pay fall into three categories, according to Saadia Zahidi, a member of WEF’s executive committee and the lead author of the report. She listed regulations banning outright discrimination; improving parental leave, childcare and tax policy; and changing incentives for companies to improve their performance, including a voluntary agreement (to avoid legislation) by the UK’s biggest public companies to work towards having at least 25% women on their boards.</p> <p>She also pointed to Turkey’s experiment with tax breaks for businesses that employ more women; and companies trying out their own policies, such as Coca-Cola making special efforts to support female suppliers and distributors. Some companies are also trialling mentoring – including younger women mentoring older male colleagues to help them understand the changes.</p> <p>Zahidi also believes a growing focus on the need for “caring” professions will put a premium on wages in those sectors, where women are dominant. </p> <p>Perversely, in some countries women are losing out because maternity and childcare policies are so generous they are taking more time out of their careers. </p> <p>Adema said this needed to be addressed by more shared parental leave between mothers and fathers – an emerging trend. Iceland and Germany were among the first countries to do this, and Japan and South Korea have enacted similar legislation in the past two years, but it is too soon to see the effect.</p> <p>“Whether we’ll ever get full employment is another question,” said Adema. “But young professionals now expect their partner to play his role: that will be one driver to greater equality.”</p> <h2>The good, the bad and the improvers:</h2> <h2><strong>Denmark</strong> </h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""516af68f91bf0afd6f6e108d6a92d74d11bae390""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/516af68f91bf0afd6f6e108d6a92d74d11bae390/0_21_5616_3371/1000.jpg"" alt=""Central Copenhagen."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Central Copenhagen.

But  <a href=""http://www.norden.org/en/nordic-council-of-ministers/ministers-for-co-operation-mr-sam/sustainable-development/indicators-for-sustainable-development-1/the-nordic-welfare-model/gender-pay-gap"">new figures</a> show there is still a gender pay gap of 16.4%, and a campaign raising the ideas of women striking from 10 November – in effect the last day of the year on which they are paid for their work – was <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KvindernesSidsteArbejdsdag/"">shared 180,000 times on Facebook</a>. </p> <p>Ole Just, an economist for HK, Denmark’s largest employment union, said: “Even though Denmark’s figure is low compared with other countries, the gap is still too big – it’s not good enough.”</p> <p>Mona Larsen, of the Danish National Centre for Social Research, agreed: “It’s not great for women at the moment, and if the trend continues it will be 111 years before there are equal wages between men and women in Denmark.” </p> <p>So why are Danish women still having to mind the gap? “It’s partly because there aren’t many women on company boards in Denmark (just 17%), so fewer women earn the big salaries,” said Larsen. “Men and women have similar educational levels in Denmark (60% of all graduates are female), but women are using their education in different ways, with more choosing to go into the public sector, where pay is lower.”</p> <p>Danish women spend fewer hours in the office than men and take on more duties at home, too. </p> <p>Researchers from Aarhus University found that <a href=""http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/valdemar-smith(617dc858-17a2-437b-95f3-4ae8cc9f5860)/publications.html"">highly skilled Danish women do more household activities than their US peers</a> and are far less likely to outsource housework. High taxes mean that a cleaner can set you back 250 kroner (£24) an hour, and egalitarian norms make paying someone else to do your dirty work an ethical grey area in Denmark.</p> <p>The same systems that help Danish women balance family and work may also be hindering them. Marie Busck, corporate social responsibility and compliance officer at the Danish retail company Tiger, said: “We have social security and childcare that makes it easy for mothers to work, but it’s still mostly women taking time off to look after children.</p> <p>“Parents get 52 weeks’ leave for a new baby, but if it’s predominantly mothers taking it and they have two children, then they’re out of the workplace for two years.” </p> <p>Busck believes this has a big impact on women’s careers and stops some reaching more senior positions: “Middle management is split more equally, but at the top there’s a big difference in the number of women and men.” </p> <p>As well as encouraging women to the top, Larsen wants more to go into the private sector. “Women should be being paid as much for their education as men,” she said. “This way we can stop certain occupations becoming ‘gendered’.”</p> <p> And the first step? “Better pay transparency – so women know what to aim for.” <em>Helen Russell in Jutland, Denmark</em></p> <h2><strong>Botswana</strong> </h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c9d78974dce74753638a4c94a1633a6e59824d63""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/c9d78974dce74753638a4c94a1633a6e59824d63/0_0_1962_1177/1000.jpg"" alt=""Research technicians in Gaborone, Botswana, where the gender pay gap is closing."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Research technicians in Gaborone, Botswana, where the gender pay gap is closing.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Jon Hrusa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Botswana, men still earn more than women, but the situation is improving rapidly. A proactive women’s movement and a receptive government have combined to narrow the gender pay gap considerably in this upper-middle-income country.</p> <p>“I think the gender pay gap is not a problem in Botswana. It used to be, but not now,” said Ida Mokereitane, executive director of Emang Basadi, a women’s rights group. </p> <p>Mokereitane credits this to serious legislative reform, such as <a href=""http://www.elaw.co.za/african%20legislation/Botswana/Employment%20Act%20of%201982.pdf"">an amended employment act</a> which recognises “the desirability of eliminating discrimination between the sexes in respect of wages for equal work”. <br /></p> <p>“It is maybe not 100% fixed, but in general women now have the same opportunities as men,” she said. “We’ve also been seeing a lot of changes, where in positions of decision-making there are a lot more women, in the public and private sector.” </p> <p>The situation was not always so good. <a href=""http://jae.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/2/127.full.pdf"">A 2001 academic study</a> found that “female employees in Botswana’s labour market [were] on average better educated than their male counterparts yet on average they [earned] much less than their male counterparts”. <br /></p> <p>Bridget Senthufhe, office manager for an international NGO, said: “I have experienced it in my career, where my male counterparts earned more than me. They earned a lot more. I worked in human resources so I saw that.” </p> <p>Pat Smythe, head of a Gaborone-based human resources firm, said significant improvements had been made. “There’s a difference globally in the pay of men and women, whether we want to admit it or not, but Botswana is one of the better countries. </p> <p>“Although the country is still no closer to having a female president, there has been a big improvement in the wage gap between the genders. The gap is now 5% or less.” In neighbouring South Africa the figure is between 15% and 20%, he pointed out.</p> <p>Smythe attributes the improvement to intensive lobbying by women’s groups and influential women within political movements. He also argues that President Ian Khama is more receptive to reform than his predecessors.</p> <p>A further statement of intent is the appointment of Pearl Matome as permanent secretary for labour and immigration, one of a handful of women in such a senior government post. </p> <p>“She’s in a critical position that can influence the total elimination of that gender gap,” said Smythe. <em>Simon Allison in Johannesburg</em></p> <h2><strong>Ecuador</strong> </h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""12fedd1d36196aec5f630859b2ae1fe66744ef24""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/12fedd1d36196aec5f630859b2ae1fe66744ef24/427_6_3158_1895/1000.jpg"" alt=""Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, who has vowed to promote wage equality."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, who has vowed to promote wage equality.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Dolores Ochoa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the WEF, Ecuador has been a trailblazer for reducing the gender pay gap over the past 10 years.</p> <p>The government of Rafael Correa has taken action to promote equality. Last March, in commemoration of International Women’s Day, the labour minister, Carlos Marx Carrasco, and UN Women representative in Ecuador, Moni Pizani, signed an agreement that both organisations would work on policies and projects to reduce pay differences. <br /></p> <p>In a report this month in <a href=""http://www.eluniverso.com/"">El Universo </a>newspaper<em>, </em>Pizani said Ecuadorian women were paid between 17% and 24% less than men, and that the gap was widest in rural areas. </p> <p>Delia Lema, a 26-year-old woman from the Chimborazo province, told the newspaper that when her husband found a better-paid job, his former employer – the manager of a farm – denied her the chance to replace him, claiming she would not be as productive as her husband.</p> <p>City women describe a similar kind of discrimination. Daniela Salazar, a lawyer and deputy dean at a private university in Quito, said that in the six years she had been teaching, her responsibilities had grown disproportionately in relation to her pay.</p> <p>“When we mention that we need to leave work at a certain time, or that we cannot go to a certain event because we have responsibilities in our homes, it is perceived as if our dedication to our work is not absolute,” she said. “That is one of the reasons why we don’t receive similar remuneration to men”.</p> <p>Last April, a law was introduced stating that an employer could not lay off a pregnant women. The law also penalised untimely and discriminatory layoffs. </p> <p>But despite the new legislation and the fact that more women are working in areas previously dominated by men, women still feel that employers perceive their gender as a disadvantage, and even as a disqualification, when hiring<strong>.</strong></p> <p>For Gabriela Salinas, commercial manager of a publishing company, the gender pay gap is particularly evident on the top rungs of the corporate world. “I’ve never experienced being paid less for being a woman, but men do get more opportunities to exercise senior management positions and, of course, they are also better paid than women in the same positions.” <em>Marcela Ribadeneira</em></p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Italy</strong> </h2>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""df9f081412089f87e3c8ca39a9b0240bf81b6012""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/df9f081412089f87e3c8ca39a9b0240bf81b6012/0_167_3500_2101/1000.jpg"" alt=""Women demonstrating in Rome in 2011 against the sex scandals involving former leader Silvio Berlusconi"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Women demonstrating in Rome in 2011 against the sex scandals involving former leader Silvio Berlusconi, which they said had hurt their dignity and reinforced outdated gender stereotypes.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Francesca Villanti, director of exhibitions at the Complesso del Vittoriano in Rome, thinks Italy has come a long way on the rights of working women and does not see much evidence of discrimination on the job – with one stark exception.</p> <p>“Once a woman gets pregnant, then it’s over,” she said. “As soon as she gets pregnant it is almost impossible to get a job or go back to work.”</p> <p>When it comes to pay equality, Italy ranks a lowly 127 out of 145 countries, and 92nd for the gap in overall pay, according to WEF data. Experts on gender issues and female executives point to a confluence of what they call “cultural issues” at the heart of the problem. </p> <p>Italy ranks poorly not only on pay standards, but also on the number of women who are working. According to OECD data, it has the third lowest female labour participation rate (51% ) among OECD countries, after Turkey and Mexico.</p> <p>Many people point to a striking lack of support when it comes to childcare, where women are still viewed as the main caregivers. Less than 30% of children under the age of three attend daycare, suggesting a lack of childcare options.</p> <p>“Most of the burden is shouldered by women,” said Francesco Grillo, a political economist and managing director of Vision and Value, a consulting firm. “This probably explains the rather large gap Italy has in terms of the employment rate of women.” </p> <p>When women do work, it is often in part-time or lower-paying jobs. And the hurdles faced by young women with children mean few rise to the top of their fields.</p> <p>For parents who do leave children in daycare, there is often an assumption that women can take many days off as their offspring settle in. The so-called <em>inserimento</em>, in which a child spends only a few hours at a time in daycare, with a parent nearby, is a familiar and frustrating rite of passage for working mothers that can take up to four weeks.<br /></p> <p>Stefania Todisco, who works for an Italian television broadcaster, believes Italy is about 30 years behind other western countries when it comes to women having equal rights and pay, which she attributes to Italian women not getting the right to vote until 1945. “In 30 years women could have the same position as other countries,” she said. “In every top level right now, women are absent.”</p> <p>But there is a potential bright spot. Women are taking more prominent roles in government and politics, even if their numbers are not significantly increasing in business and other areas.</p> <p>Thanks in part to a <em>quota rosa</em> that is forcing more gender equity in government, many advocates for gender and pay equity think the changing public face of government will eventually lead to legislation that supports working women, and that pay will follow. <em>Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome</em></p>"

I’ve done plenty of shameful things in cricket matches. Facing a hefty defeat in a one-day match out in Melbourne’s east one day, I pretended I couldn’t find a ball that’d flown over the fence and for a good 10 minutes held up the game under the incorrect assumption that rain was on the way. The sun kept shining and we kept getting punished. All I deserved, really.</p> <p>Sam Fiddian is talking himself down but has a lovely addition to sub-fielder chat. “Since it seems the sound I hear is the bottom of a barrel being vigorously scraped, might I offer that the greatest substitute fielder in literary history appears in LP Hartley’s <em>The Go-Between</em>; the narrator appears as a sub, takes a match-winning catch, but appears on the scoresheet anonymously - a moment full of symbolic significance for anyone who has read the book, and probably boring the arse off anyone who hasn’t.”</p> <p>Warner and Smith look like they’re in a hurry for runs here; maybe the Aussies will chase a result after all.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56496769e4b0ced428cb2b74"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T05:24:32.532Z"">5.24am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>4th over: Australia 26-1 ( Warner 13, Smith 13)</strong></p> <p>Smith took an age to get going in the first innings but perhaps the sight of Taylor rekindling his form with such ease has freed his mind a little because he cracks Boult for another attractive boundary, this time pulling to deep square leg. Not to be outdone, Warner belts one of his own with a blazing cut shot to finish the over.</p> <p>Phil Rebbeck has another nice addition to the sub-fielding files. “As far as sub fielders taking catches in Test matches goes, one of the most memorable was Ian Gould’s at Melbourne in 1983 to dismiss Greg Chappell. England went on to win a thrilling test by 3 runs (although they almost blew it).” </p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-5649667be4b06fb53392c910"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T05:19:30.500Z"">5.19am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>3rd over: Australia 16-1 ( Warner 8, Smith 8)</strong></p> <p>With Khawaja done for, captain Steve Smith shuffles back into the No3 slot and Southee’s looking to get a bite from him outside off stump as well. Smith bides his time before unleashing a pair of fearful drives through cover, both of which slam into the fence. </p> <p>Neil Zimmerman has a truly shameful sub-fielding story. “I once feigned an attempt at catching a team mate whilst substitute fielding for the opposition purely out of spite after they refused to give one of their own out stumped (whilst I was keeping) despite the fact their bat was clearly in the air and admitting as such. I resorted to the old “running to far under the ball trick”.

In the Bushrangers’ first innings there was 98 runs for Glenn Maxwell and 58 for all-rounder Marcus Stoinis. In WA’s reply, Shaun Marsh ended up with 64 and Michael Klinger 70. Both of them will vie for Usman Khawaja’s spot in the 3rd Test. The bad news in that innings was for bowlers Peter Siddle and James Pattinson, both of whom only managed one wicket as leggie Fawad Ahmed picked up five.</p> <p>New South Wales’ clash with Tassie took on a greater level of importance for Ed Cowan and Nic Maddinson, but with 13 and 6 respectively, they hardly made a statement. Doug Bollinger has 6 wickets thusfar and Jackson Bird bowled tidily for 3 for Tasmania.</p> <p>The only player in realistic contention out of the South Australia-Queensland game is Redbacks batsman Callum Ferguson but he failed with the bat in the first innings and hasn’t batted yet in the second.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56493786e4b091c2edb6cea7"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T02:08:07.094Z"">2.08am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p> <p>“If it’s not his last Test I think we’re getting very close to seeing the end of Mitchell Johnson.” - former Australian Test captain Mark Taylor.</p> <p>Hello OBOers and welcome to day four of the 2nd Test. To start with let’s just drink in that quote, which was the first words out of Taylor’s lips as I flicked on the TV today. He’s not the only one thinking it, to be fair, with speculation swirling that the champion paceman might call it a day after this Test. More info on that as it’s at hand.</p> <p>For now we focus on the resumption of Ross Taylor’s magnificent double-century and the possibility, just whisper it, that he might progress to three hundred today.

New Zealand are all over them.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""c5f831aa7cd81365ca4355510b9b55ead7a4b8ab""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/c5f831aa7cd81365ca4355510b9b55ead7a4b8ab/0_0_4884_2931/1000.jpg"" alt=""Steve Smith in the wake of the Shaun Marsh run out."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Steve Smith in the wake of the Shaun Marsh run out.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Rick Rycroft/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/CricketAus/statuses/670451784096153600"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">A mix-up and some superb fielding from McCullum.

New Zealand’s first innings was all about Peter S. The Aussies were a completely different proposition with him in the side. The great Mike Selvey often speaks of the importance of partnership bowling. El Siddle gives good partnership with absolutely everybody. He’s the glue, the hub. He’s the satisfying click as the self-assembly unit finally comes together.”</p> <p>“And thus, I understood something. P Siddle is <em>exactly</em> like good grammar or deft punctuation. It may not win a lot of prizes, but stuff’s just gonna make a lot more sense when it’s included.”</p> <p>I nodded my head through all of that, RMclW. Siddle is a phenomenon in a way; so often he’s the catalyst for a superb team bowling performance – nibbling away industriously and tying the batsmen down at one end while others go the jugular at the other – but equally, so often people completely disregard this fact and write him off. </p> <p>Also, I think because he does the yeoman’s work, people assume he’s older than he actually is. He’s only just turned 31. With luck and with no further drop-off in pace, he could theoretically bowl this way for another 3-4 years. That’s a 300-wicket Test bowler, right there. A champion by many definitions. You compared him to Merv yesterday and I think that’s apt, because he’s equally at ease doing the team thing as he is pretending he’s a strike bowler. We all know he’s really not a strike bowler, but enough batsmen start to believe it that the basic facts don’t really matter. What’s not to love about the guy?</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""90a08885409425aadafb633e34adf1a905728240""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/90a08885409425aadafb633e34adf1a905728240/0_161_3000_1801/1000.jpg"" alt=""Peter Siddle gives his adoring fans the thumbs up after claiming his 200th Test wicket."" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Peter Siddle gives his adoring fans the thumbs up after claiming his 200th Test wicket.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Morne de Klerk/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56591b71e4b03bf401a0bc7e"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-28T03:15:34.749Z"">3.15am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Emails please...</strong></p> <p>Has anybody read a decent new cricket book this summer?

Russell Jackson here to take you through the first two sessions before the arrival of Rob Smyth. The big news this morning, as you can already gather, is that Mitchell Starc will be playing no further part with the ball, in this Test and probably for the rest of the summer tool, which is good news only to West Indies batsmen. Looking ahead, it’s a real blow for the one-day series; there was nothing I was more looking forward to than Starc steaming in with the white ball.</p> <p>This first session promises to be a fascinating one; Steve Smith and Adam Voges will doubtless find it a lot easier to negotiate than the tense closing stages last night and opportunities also await the Marsh brothers. My sense: we can probably make alternative plans for Tuesday at a minimum. Could be wrong. Feel free to get in contact throughout the day, one that might at least adding to the season’s list of novelty sub-fielders. I’m spewing that I missed out on welcoming Australian masseur Grant Baldwin to the fray in the final session last night. Maybe we’ll see him again today. You can get me on russell.jackson@theguardian.com or via Twitter – @rustyjacko – with your thoughts on that and anything else.</p> <p>Feel free to send me any updates on where you’re watching the game, too.</p>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/smokiedawson/statuses/670434020841287681"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Day 2 preparations.

would ever authorise military action against Islamist extremists</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>, the opposition Labour leader in the UK, has already given at least two interviews about the Paris attacks (see <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/16/paris-attacks-france-airstrikes-isis-raqqa-syria-live#block-5649ab18e4b091c2edb6cf4a"">10.36am </a>and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/16/paris-attacks-france-airstrikes-isis-raqqa-syria-live#block-5649dc1de4b0e98c91b0ceee"">2.56pm)</a> but the most revealing is easily<a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34832023""> this new one,</a> by the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. Corbyn, a relatively obscure leftwing backbencher until his surprise victory in the leadership election in September, is probably the most pacifist figure to lead a major UK political party since the 1930s and this interview revealed how different his views are from David Cameron’s - or from Ed Miliband’s, his predecessor as Labour leader.</p> <p>Here are the main points.<br /></p> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn refused to say whether he would ever support military action against Islamist extremists.</strong> He was asked about this three times. In his first reply he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I think I would support security measures, policing measures, to deal with these issues, but I think we have to be careful if we act illegally or irrationally; we stand by the rule of international law, we stand by the charter of the United Nations, we stand by our own law. If we start doing random acts without legal backing for them, then we don’t strengthen our position in the world. So I think the answer to your question is that we have to abide by the law.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that in some circumstances military action against Islamist extremists would be legal, he said whether or not he would approve was a hypothetical question. Bombing Syria was not the right way forward, and he would not support it at this stage, he said. When Kuenssberg pressed him for a third time he replied:</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I’m not saying I would or I wouldn’t. I’m saying its a hypothetical question at this stage. My view is we have to review our foreign policy, review the situation that’s going on in the region and listen to words put forward by Barack Obama on behalf of the United States and<a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/11/15/ban-ki-moon-warns-international-community-to-respect-rule-law-in-response-to/""> Ban Ki-moon on behalf of the United Nations.</a> They made some very wise comments over the weekend. There has to at the end be a political solution to it. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Corbyn said that he would not be happy to order the police or troops to operate a “shoot to kill” policy in relation to terrorists on British streets. </strong>Asked about this, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I’m not happy with a shoot-to-kill policy in general. I think that is quite dangerous and I think that can often by counter-productive. I think you have to have security that prevents people firing off weapons where they can ... The idea that you end up with a war on the streets is not a good thing. Surely you have to work to try and prevent these things happening. That has got to be the priority. </p> </blockquote> <p>This story was prompted by <a href=""http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/defence/article4615007.ece"">a front page Times story on Monday (paywall) saying special forces have been ordered to intervene and shoot to kill if jihadis stage a Paris-style attack in a British city.</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>He said he thought Western intervention in the Middle East was partly to blame for the Paris attack. </strong>Asked if he agreed with a post from Stop the War on Twitter (subsequently deleted) saying Paris was “reaping [the] whirlwind of western support for extremist violence in Middle East”, Corbyn replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I would not use that language. I would use the language that has been put forward by the thoughtful words of President Obama saying we had to reckon with what happened there.</p> </blockquote> <p>But he said he did think Western policy was a factor in explaining the attacks.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>We have created a situation where some of these forces have grown. Obviously, [I] absolutely blame those that did it. Absolutely, obviously, Isil are totally wrong. Obviously they are some kind of nihilistic movement that are a threat to everybody. Is the way of dealing with them bombing which will include civilian casualties? Bombing does. Or is the way to obviously make the necessary security protective measures in each country, but also to try and get a solution in Syria? We can’t go on with more and more people leaving Syria who are refugees from all wars ...</p> <p>We’ve got a record, all the Western countries, of interventions, all across the whole piste, and has peace got better as a result of it? Well, I think you know the answer as well as I do to that.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government should abandon its planned police cuts to enhance security in this country.</strong> The government should also recognise the role community policing can play in building up good community relations, he said. <br /></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he received a security briefing from the government on Saturday about the Paris attacks.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government had not yet asked for his support on the issue of extending airstrikes against Isis to Syria. </strong></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-16T18:18:05.285Z"">at 6.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-564a0ec6e4b0e0595dc6c37d"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""profile/jonathan-bucks""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T17:20:18.154Z"">5.20pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Brother of fugitive suspect: 'We don't know where he is'</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Mohamed Abdeslam, the brother of two suspects linked to the attacks on Friday in Paris was <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/16/paris-attacks-france-airstrikes-isis-raqqa-syria-live#block-5649cd26e4b029d663c36993"">released by Belgian police this afternoon after several hours in custody</a>.

May added that she would be pressing for more information sharing in relation to firearms. </li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The UK has some of the toughest firearms laws in the world. The sorts of weaponry used in the attacks in Paris in January, and those that appear to have been used last Friday, are not readily available in the UK. We must therefore focus on tackling firearms entering and moving throughout the EU, and ensuring that we have the right capabilities at the UK border to detect firearms being smuggled in.</p> <p>This Friday, I will attend an extraordinary meeting of the European justice and home affairs council, where I will press the need for greater information sharing, passenger name records and action on firearms. In the UK, we have seen tough legislation work and so we want to see action taken to make a difference to the availability of firearms in Europe, particularly assault rifles.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the threat from Islamic State (Isis or Isil) was “evolving”.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The international investigation into the attacks is ongoing, but we know that Isil have claimed responsibility. This is not the first time Isil has struck in Europe. We have seen attacks either inspired or directed by the group in France, Belgium, Denmark, as well as attacks in Lebanon, Turkey and Kuwait, and the ongoing devastating violence in Syria and Iraq. And in June, 30 British nationals along with others were killed by a gunman at a tourist resort in Tunisia. It also looks increasingly likely that the Russian Metrojet plane which crashed two weeks ago in Egypt was brought down by a bomb. But the scale of this latest attack and the degree of coordination and planning leave us with little doubt that the threat is evolving.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said the UK border force was helping French authorities with “targeted security checks” on passengers travelling to France. </strong>Since Friday, the border force has also been intensifying checks generally, May said. The police presence at some events has been increased.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>May said that, although there are already plans in place to deal with Paris-style gun attacks, these would be revised.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She confirmed that David Cameron will make a statement to MPs about the Paris attacks on Tuesday.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""80210bb6505d1d2c94c2688c9d0ce1c857c46e18""> <img src=""http://media.guim.co.uk/80210bb6505d1d2c94c2688c9d0ce1c857c46e18/113_0_597_359/500.jpg"" alt=""Theresa May"" width=""500"" height=""301"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Theresa May speaking in the House of Commons.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: BBC Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-16T16:32:50.692Z"">at 4.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5649fcbbe4b0e98c91b0cf59"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T15:58:51.631Z"">3.58pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Here’s a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/16/us-france-paris-attacks-barack-obama-video"">video</a> from Barack Obama’s comments to the G20 just now, where he said the US and France had made a new intelligence agreement.</p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-16T17:56:20.238Z"">at 5.56pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-5649fc28e4b0a51fe2018546"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T15:56:37.691Z"">3.56pm <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>François Hollande has finished speaking in Versailles, and we will have a more detailed summary of his speech in the next few minutes.</p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>No barbarians will prevent us from living how we have decided to live.

The prime minister’s spokesman would not give any further details.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Downing Street rejected a call for Cameron to abandon his promise to get Commons approval before authorising airstrikes against Isis in Syria.</strong> <strong>Sir Alan Duncan</strong>, a Conservative MP and former minister, said this morning that Cameron should no longer feel bound by this promise.</li> </ul>  <figure class=""element element-tweet"" data-canonical-url=""https://twitter.com/AlanDuncanMP/statuses/666211619316375552"">  <blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">The Prime Minister should be released from the obligation to come to Parliament ahead of any urgent action against ISIS targets in Syria.</p>&mdash; Alan Duncan (@AlanDuncanMP) <a href=""https://twitter.com/AlanDuncanMP/status/666211619316375552"">November 16, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But the spokesman said Cameron did not agree.

But I will start the conversation with Vladimir Putin by talking about the things that we agree about, which is that Isil, and this radicalised Islamist extremism, is just as much a threat to Russia – potentially more of a threat to Russia – than it is to Europe. </p> <p>In his remarks last night, Vladimir Putin very much recognised that.</p> <p>The disagreement has been that we think Assad should go at once, and obviously Russia has taken a different view. We have to find a settlement where Assad leaves and there is a goverment that can bring Syria together, and we mustn’t let the gap between us be the altar on which this country of Syria is slaughtered. That is the challenge.</p> <p>That is going to take compromises. I think that you can see, from what is going on in Vienna with these talks, that the British, the Americans, the French are prepared to make compromises.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he would consider speeding up the introduction of the investigatory powers bill on internet surveillance in light of the Paris attacks.</strong> The bill is still in draft form and not due to become law until the end of 2016. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/15/paris-attacker-named-investigation-continues-live-updates#block-564869dfe4b0ced428cb2a2d"">Yesterday, the Home Office ruled out rushing it through parliament.</a> But when Cameron was asked about this, he gave a different line.

But that is exactly what we are doing right now.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that, while he favoured Britain extending airstrikes against Isis to Syria, he would not risk losing a vote on this in the Commons because that would be “damaging” to the country’s reputation.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I support the action in Syria. We are part of the enablers of that. It is happening anyway. The question is should we go further and join that action. I have always said that we should. Isil don’t recognise the border between Iraq and Syria and neither should we. But I need to build the argument, I need to take it to parliament, I need to convince more people. We won’t hold that vote unless we can see that parliament would endorse that action, because to fail on this would be damaging – it is not a question of damaging the government; it is a question of not damaging our country and its reputation. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also said Isis had lost 30% of the territory it held in Iraq as a result of the allied airstrikes there which have involved the UK.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cameron said he would be willing to take his children to the England-France football match in London tomorrow.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>I think it is very important that we carry on with our lives.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether the British government had had advance warning of an attack of this kind</strong>.

In previous international law decisions involving actions against a non-state, the exercise of this right of self-defence has not been considered lawful.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read the full article here: <br /></p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/16/isis-attack-on-paris-may-be-an-act-of-war-but-retaliation-might-not-be-lawful"">Isis attack on Paris may be an 'act of war' but retaliation may not be lawful</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56497882e4b06fb53392c91e"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T06:45:13.305Z"">6.45am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>Luxembourg, currently holding the EU presidency, has called an emergency meeting of the 28 interior and justice ministers in Brussels on Friday.</p> <p>France has requested the meeting in order to “reinforce the European response and to ensure the putting into place of agreed measures” after the attacks on Paris.</p> <p>The investigation into the attacks is crossing European borders, with the revelation that several of those suspected of involvement in the attacks lived in or had links to Belgium; and the claim that at least one of the attackers might have posed as a Syrian refugee to travel across Europe from Greece.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-564978aae4b0ced428cb2b8e"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T06:36:53.864Z"">6.36am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>France will pause at noon on Monday (11am GMT; 10pm AEST; 6am ET) for a minute of silence to remember the victims of the attack.</p> <p>The latest death toll stands as 129, of whom 103 have so far been identified.

From early reports it appears most were part of a general “preventative” anti-terrorist swoop as part of the country’s state of emergency and not directly linked to the search for the perpetrators of the Paris attacks.</p> <p>The decree made by the French council of ministers at an emergency meeting after the Paris attacks, relating to the first paragraph of the 1955 law on a <strong>“state of emergency”, which gives the authorities extraordinary powers to order home searches “day or night”. </strong><br /></p> <p>In Toulouse, French media reported a “preventative operation” in and around the area that was home to <strong>Mohamed Merah</strong>, known as the “ride-by killer” who gunned down several soldiers, then attacked children at a Jewish school, murdering a a total of seven people over several days before dying in a police shoot-out in 2012.</p> <p>At least three people have been taken into police custody. Reports say these were “administrative searches” on properties as part of a general anti-terrorist operation and not part of the Paris attack investigation. Police seized “illegal substances” including cannabis, and one weapon.</p> <p>In Grenoble and around, <a href=""http://www.ledauphine.com/isere-sud/2015/11/16/operation-anti-terroriste-cette-nuit-dans-grenoble-et-son-agglomeration"">Le Dauphiné Libéré newspaper</a> is reporting that units of gendarmes carried out an anti-terrorist operation at around 15 sites during which “more than half a dozen people were arrested and arms seized”. The paper said the operation, which lasted an hour, was part of a national swoop.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.lobservateur.fr/faits-divers/faits-divers-sambre/2015/11/16/attentats-de-paris-descente-de-police-cette-nuit-a-jeumont/"">Another local newspaper in the north of France</a> in the Pas de Calais region is reporting a raid at the town of Jeumont near the border with Belgium. Reports suggest gendarmes in “around 50 vans” swooped on the town, but it is not known whether the raid is directly linked to the Paris attacks, or being carried out as part of a general operation in France.</p> <p>There was another overnight operation by gendarmes at Bobigny a suburb of Paris. Again details are sketchy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=""block-56496e7ee4b091c2edb6cedc"" class=""block is-summary"" data-block-contributor=""profile/clairephipps""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T06:01:23.582Z"">6.01am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">What we know so far</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <h2>Anti-terrorism raids and the hunt for suspects</h2> <ul> <li><strong>French police continue to hunt</strong><strong> for Salah Abdeslam –</strong> believed to be <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/15/paris-attacker-named-investigation-continues-live-updates#block-5648bccae4b06fb53392c853"">one of three brothers involved in Friday night’s attack</a>, who is <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/16/paris-attacks-france-airstrikes-isis-raqqa-syria-live#block-56491f8de4b091c2edb6ce94"">on the run</a> – <strong> </strong>and others thought to have been involved in orchestrating the attacks on Paris on Friday.</li> <li>Overnight raids have taken place in <strong>Toulouse</strong>, <strong>Grenoble</strong>, <strong>Jeumont</strong> (on the French-Belgian border), and the Paris suburb of <strong>Bobigny</strong>.

The restaurant had been unusually empty the night before, with just a couple of customers at tables and a few more drinking outside. Its Tunisian cook, <strong>Ammar Bensalem</strong>, was in the back kitchen with his friend Fatih. And then the shooting started: sudden bursts of automatic fire.<br /></p> <p>“I heard shots. We hid in the kitchen. Eight people joined us,” Bensalem said on Sunday, outside his workplace of two years. He said he emerged to find carnage: a woman alive but bleeding profusely from the arm, broken glass, police. Five people had been shot dead immediately in front of the restaurant. Medics had taken them away.</p> <p>Beneath its menu sign – “Pizza, Pasta, Salad” – rivulets of blood were still visible.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p> As fear receded, some families emerged defiantly with children. “This time it’s too much. I don’t want to leave this kind of world to my kids,” <strong>Sophie DuPont</strong> said, speaking outside La Belle Equipe restaurant in the rue de Charonne, where 18 people were murdered. She was with her baby daughter and four-year-old. She added: “If we have to fight, we will fight, just as our grandfathers did.”<br /></p> <p>Around them, people were laying flowers and candles. Two bullets hit the neighbouring sushi bar; someone had threaded flowers through the holes. There were messages. Most were positive: “Peace, love, unity for my beautiful street”, “Dear Freedom” and “I am Paris” written on three tubs of crocuses. A few were angry: “Death to illiterate barbarians.”</p> <p>And: “We won’t allow you to make this world rotten.”</p> </blockquote> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/parisians-reclaim-streets-survivors-recall-terror-of-massacre"">Parisians reclaim their streets as survivors recall terror of massacre</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2015-11-16T17:48:34.221Z"">at 5.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-56492d1ae4b06fb53392c8e8"" class=""block"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2015-11-16T01:14:24.341Z"">1.14am <span class=""timezone"">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=""block-elements"">  <p>My colleague <strong>Emma Graham-Harrison</strong> <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-fake-passport-raises-questions-over-bombers-identities"">has been delving into the story</a> of the passport found near the body of the one of the Paris suicide bombers – was it the passport of a Syrian refugee, or someone purporting to be one?</p> <blockquote> <p>The discovery raised as many questions as it answered, because it was unclear whether the passport was real or fake and whether the bomber had used it to get to <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/paris"">Paris</a> himself or acquired it illegally from someone else.</p> <p>On 3 October, a man using the name Ahmed Almohamed arrived on the small Greek island of Leros and registered as a refugee with the Syrian passport.</p> <p> The traveller apparently crossed to a neighbouring island and there <a href=""http://www.protothema.gr/world/article/527346/protothemagr-exclusive-the-names-and-tickets-of-the-bombists-that-passed-through-greece/"">boarded a ferry to Athens</a> on 5 October, buying a ticket together with one other man, travel receipts published by the Greek newspaper Protothema show.<br /></p> <p>Within two days he had apparently passed through northern Greece to Macedonia and reached the border crossing with Serbia …<br /></p> <p>French authorities have yet to say whether they have managed to match fingerprints to those registered along with the passport in Greece.
